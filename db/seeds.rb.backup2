That is clearly the case for the Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art and its dramatic new building, a stunning—some would say startling—addition to the 150-year-old institution that has occupied its landmark Foundation Building on Cooper Square since 1859... Rather than looking at it as a historic monument, [Mr. Mayne] sought to emulate its advances in the spirit and character of contemporary New York... To this native New Yorker who has watched the city evolve over decades and treasures its unrelenting diversity, Mr. Mayne has got it just right... This is high architectural drama, a luminous and exhilarating invitation into the structure's life and use. It is not building as bling. It is how architecture turns program and purpose into art.

Since Rizzoli published Volume I of the Morphosis series in 1989, the Los Angeles—based firm has continued to push its intricate modernism into new territories. In the tradition of its four visually groundbreaking predecessors, this fifth volume packs 500 illustrations into a comprehensive tour of Morphosis’s activity. New works covered in Volume V include Cal Trans Headquarters in Los Angeles (2004); the San Francisco Federal Office building (2006); the Wayne L. Morse United States Courthouse in Eugene, Oregon (2006); and the University of Cincinnati Student Recreation Center (2006).

  {content: "<p>A dramatic example of sustainable design principles, the San Francisco Federal Building’s shape and orientation maximize natural airflow for cooling and ventilation, and take advantage of natural daylight for the majority of the office interior. These features, combined with a number of other energy-saving elements, significantly reduce overall energy consumption compared to conventional commercial office buildings in the United States.</p>\\r\\n<p><h5>Climate Control</h5></p>\\r\\n<p>Throughout the year, San Francisco’s design temperature ranges between 44 and 78 degrees Fahrenheit. The new San Francisco Federal Building takes advantage of the temperate climate to provide a comfortable interior environment while reducing energy consumption.</p>\\r\\n<p>As a whole, the building is best understood as a hybrid that includes different space conditioning strategies appropriate for different locations in the building.  The first five levels, with high concentrations of people and equipment, are fully air-conditioned.  Above the fifth floor, the windows automatically adjust, allowing fresh air directly into the building for natural ventilation and free cooling. The window system creates a “living skin” that allows the building to breathe. Breezes pass through openings on the windward side and are vented out through the leeward wall, with control based on wind speed and direction.</p>{break}\\r\\n<p>{file}6358|Perforated metal building skin|left{/file}\\r\\n{file}6359|Skin detail|left{/file}\\r\\n{file}6361|Building skin with automated windows open|left{/file}\\r\\n{file}7405|Tower air circulation diagram|left{/file}</p><br style=\"clear:left\" />\\r\\n<p>A computerized system, known as the building automation system (BAS), controls and monitors all of the building’s mechanical equipment including those devices that are used to maintain internal environmental conditions and lighting levels. On the naturally ventilated floors, the computer system opens and closes windows, vents and sunscreens in response to temperature within the building as well as external environmental conditions. The window wall features manually operated windows for occupant control of the internal environment and includes a heating system integrated into the mullions. A minimal number of central, fully enclosed offices and meeting rooms are served by local, supplemental cooling units to accommodate higher density occupancies. During the night, the BAS opens the windows to flush out heat build-up and allows the nighttime air to cool the building's concrete interior. Throughout the day the thermal mass of the exposed concrete columns, shear walls and wave-form ceilings help cool the occupants of the building.</p>\\r\\n<p>{file}6364|Wave forms passively cool day lit interiors|left{/file}\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>In the tower, the design of the high-performance façades is critical to the functioning of the natural ventilation.

The new San Francisco Federal Building is expected to surpass the GSA’s target as well as California’s stringent Title 24 Energy Code.  The naturally ventilated floors are projected to have an average energy consumption of less than 25,000 Btu per square foot per year, a significant improvement over the national standard.</p>\\r\\n<p><h5>Electrical</h5></p>\\r\\n<p>Lighting is typically the largest energy cost for an office building, representing up to 40 percent of a facility's total energy load. The new San Francisco Federal Building's lighting strategies improve the workplace and are a critical facet of this project's sustainable design. Approximately 85 percent of the workspace is illuminated with natural light.</p>\\r\\n<p>Ambient light, the general illumination in an office, comes from sunlight channeled through the windows and reflected off walls and ceilings to extend its reach with minimum glare and intensity.  With an average overall ceiling height in the tower of 13 feet, natural daylight will penetrate deep into work spaces. Powered lights are also provided to supplement the natural light. Through simple sensors, the building's automated systems manage the balance between powered and natural daylight. The powered lights are on only when people are at their workstations. Together, these approaches reduce energy used for lighting by approximately 26 percent.</p>\\r\\n<p>{file}625|Daylit interior|left{/file}</p><br style=\"clear:left\" />\\r\\n<p><h5>Building Materials</h5></p>\\r\\n<p>The San Francisco Federal Building incorporates building materials and construction strategies that minimize waste and energy consumption. The building minimizes pollution by replacing high proportions of Portland cement in its concrete foundations and frame. During the manufacturing process, Portland cement is associated with very high levels of greenhouse gas emissions.  In the Federal Building’s concrete mixture, 50% of the pollution-intensive Portland cement is replaced with blast furnace slag, a recycled waste product from the steel industry, significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions resulting from conventional concrete. This environmentally sound choice also results in higher-strength concrete and has a warm, light-colored tone that contributes to the favorable daylight penetration within the office space.\\r\\nThe GSA mandated that 75 percent of materials used during construction be recycled. The project recycled 87 percent of its waste material. \\r\\nCarpet, paint and furniture were carefully considered with respect to the project's sustainable goals.</p>\\r\\n<p>{file}3399|Energy Usage Diagram|left{/file}\\r\\n{file}3400|Energy Savings Comparison Diagram|left{/file}\\r\\n{file}3401|High Tower Energy Consumption Diagram|left{/file}\\r\\n{file}3402|Energy Savings Diagram|left{/file}\\r\\n{file}3403|Reduction in Carbon Dioxide Emissions Diagram|left{/file}</p>\\r\\n", rank: 1, project_id: 628, component_type_id: 7},

  {content: "<p><h5>Sustainable Design Intent & Innovation</h5>\\r\\nThe Wayne Lyman Morse United States Courthouse demanded the reconciliation of two seemingly discordant needs: security and sustainability. A Security Level IV facility - one level below buildings such as the Pentagon - comprises a high volume of public contact with agencies including high-risk law enforcement and intelligence agencies, courts, judicial offices, and highly sensitive government records. This facility entails stringent and complex security requirements, including perimeter-parking restrictions, vehicle barriers, and building setback requirements (against vehicle bombing); blast mitigation; defense against ballistic, biological and chemical attacks, and more. The owner also sought sustainability equivalent to LEED Silver, which posed a unique challenge to the design team: create a building that unites the implied densities of security (thickness, rigidity, separation) with essential values of sustainability (transparency, airiness, sensitivity, connectivity). The team engaged in a concerted effort toward this reconciliation, delivering a building that garnered LEED Gold certification.The design implements innovative strategies to provide building security within a living, breathing, organic design vernacular wrapped around real world sustainable features: a dramatic, ecologically-sensitive transformation of the site; extensive glazing for natural light and connectivity; energy and water-saving systems and fixtures; and an architectural expression of judicial presence at a healthy, human scale.</p>\\r\\n{break}\\r\\n<p><h5>Regional/Community Design & Connectivity</h5>\\r\\nSet on a previously developed site along the edge of central Eugene, the courthouse occupies part of a small district of warehouses that the City plans to replace with a mix of new commercial uses. Within this evolving urban fabric, the courthouse serves as a new civic nucleus and model for conscientious development. The site’s location within a half mile of more than 18 basic services and three high-density residential neighborhoods fosters reductions in transportation and associated impacts. Existing nearby public rail and bus lines connect the courthouse to the greater community. To further encourage public transportation, the project team worked with Lane Transit District representatives to create new public transit stops specifically serving the courthouse. Additionally, the GSA provides preferred parking to employees and tenants using low emitting / fuel-efficient vehicles. The design articulates the building / site perimeter to meet stringent security needs, but makes that security transparent to create an inviting approach for users and visitors. Security barriers are practically invisible, taking the form of a series of cubic retaining walls holding turf grass. As visitors approach the main entrance from the south, periodic wall openings admit pedestrians to an internal public plaza at ground level.</p>\\r\\n<p>{file}347|Main entrance is easily visible and accessible from road with highly effective security berms visible along bottom|left{/file}</p><br style=\"clear:left\" />\\r\\n<p><h5>Land Use & Site Ecology</h5> \\r\\nThe site previously housed a large industrial food processing plant. The abandoned, metal-roofed structures and surrounding sea of asphalt created dramatic heat islands, and resulted in large volumes of storm water sheet draining to the surrounding right of way for dispersal. The courthouse design incorporates several measures to reverse this negative impact to the local ecology. In lieu of large expanses of parking, the new courthouse incorporates 80 underground parking stalls. The landscaping plan restores approximately 37% of the site to natural percolation rates and connects the courthouse to the ecologies of the Millrace open space to the east and the Willamette River and Alton Baker Park to the north. Security barrier planters and a landscape extension on the east use hardy, self-sustaining native and adaptive plant species to avoid irrigation and the use of pesticides, while a “forest” of incense cedar, quaking aspen and European beech populate the area between the courthouse and Mill Street. In all but one case, plant zones are interconnected to allow plants, helpful insects and water to interact naturally.</p>\\r\\n<p>{file}6326|Young \"forest\" visible on left|left{/file}</p><br style=\"clear:left\" />\\r\\n<p><h5>Bioclimatic Design</h5>\\r\\nEugene’s mean annual temperature is 11.1 degrees Celsius with annual rainfall of 129.3 centimeters. Cool temperatures and high precipitation warranted a responsive restoration of natural site permeation through native plantings and reconnection to the local ecology. These plantings further provide natural windbreaks against prevailing winds on the west, sound dampening and exhaust mitigation from adjacent traffic, and sun shading. The design responds to the challenge of connecting building interiors to the bioclimatic surroundings without compromising the courthouse’s high security needs. Public areas, corridors, and administrative office areas use extensive glazing to bring natural light into the interior and provide visual connection to the city, river and mountains. Furthermore, this courthouse is unique in drawing natural light into the courtrooms themselves. Typical courtroom design surrounds courtrooms with judges’ chambers and jury rooms as an easy way to create isolation for security and make use of the higher ceilings required by court proceedings - in effect, land locking courtrooms. By locating jury rooms and judges’ chambers on the floors above, the design allows for the placement of clerestory windows along the courtroom outer walls as well as feature windows at the judge’s bench to bring in natural light.</p>\\r\\n<p>{file}371|Innovative daylit courtroom interiors|left{/file}</p><br style=\"clear:left\" />\\r\\n<p><h5>Light & Air</h5>\\r\\nThrough a combination of extensive daylighting, dimmable lighting and innovative HVAC systems, the design responds to the building architecture with sensitivity while creating bright, airy, healthy and comfortable spaces. An underfloor air distribution system serves a majority of spaces, including the six courtrooms. The system consists of a raised floor on pedestals with air supplied through the underfloor plenum, and with individual user control provided through strategically located floor diffusers. This system provides more efficient air-conditioning, uses less fan power, and provides better air quality than a traditional overhead ductwork system. In response to high ceilings and extensive glazing in the atrium, jury assembly area, and third floor public corridors, the courthouse utilizes radiant floors for efficient heating and cooling. Hot or cool water piped through PEX tubes encased in a concrete floor slab modulates space temperatures, using less energy than standard HVAC systems while providing superior comfort for tall spaces with extensive glass. A supplemental air system provides ventilation air and a portion of the cooling capacity for public spaces. Air is delivered through wall stud cavities to hidden grilles at the bottom of the walls, supplying air at low levels and low velocities.</p>\\r\\n<p><h5>Water Cycle</h5> \\r\\nThe courthouse design dramatically improves the site’s water cycle. The demolition of the former sea of hardscape and subsequent redevelopment of the site to serve the courthouse goals reclaims the site to its natural pervious levels. Pervious ground covering and planting beds now cover 37% of the site, allowing for on-site infiltration of storm water. The use of native and drought-tolerant plants, such as quaking aspens, Saskatoon serviceberry and incense cedar in on-site planting beds takes advantage of natural precipitation and reduces the Total Potable Water Applied (TPWA) by approximately 59% over baseline analysis. While not included in TPWA calculations, water use is further reduced through the inclusion of automatic rain shutoffs and moisture sensors in the irrigation system to prevent wasteful irrigation cycles. Additionally, the hardy native / adaptive plant species allow for the restriction of insect and disease-controlling chemicals in landscape maintenance, which (amongst other environmental benefits) precludes groundwater contamination. The building system minimizes potable water use and associated sanitary waste with water-saving fixtures including waterless urinals, and ultra-low flow lavatories, sinks and showers. Combined with fixture sensors at public locations, these measures result in savings of more than 40% over baseline case analysis.</p>\\r\\n<p><h5>Energy Flows & Energy Future</h5> \\r\\nNumerous measures were incorporated to minimize the overall energy use of the courthouse, ultimately resulting in estimated energy savings of 38.39% compared to a baseline model. Incorporated measures include daylighting to reduce dependence on artificial lighting with its resultant energy consumption and heat load, energy load reduction analyses made possible by designing for aggregate load averages and peaks rather than equipment maximum load ratings, adding fluorescent fixtures with dimmable ballasts controlled by daylight sensors, and incorporating extensive use of occupancy sensor controlled lighting in unoccupied spaces. \\r\\nNumerous efficiencies were realized mechanically as well, including purging 100% of the outside air at nighttime to cool the building by removing the heat build-up of the day; integrating the “right-sized” mechanical equipment associated with a displacement ventilation delivery system; employing the extensive use of variable speed motors; designing for efficient operation at average, not peak, loading; minimum losses due to drive and winding by the incorporation of high performance, premium efficiency motors; and using high performance glazing to minimize radiant heat loss.</p>\\r\\n<p>{file}363|Daylit interior spaces|left{/file}</p><br style=\"clear:left\" />\\r\\n<p><h5>Materials & Construction</h5>\\r\\nExtensive use of construction materials derived from recycled content became a major contributing factor to the overall sustainability of the final built form. The use of recycled steel and aluminum components, including rebar, structural steel, steel deck, cold metal framing, metal stairs, formed metal fabrications, stainless steel detention equipment and furniture, aluminum entrances and storefronts, and factory formed metal wall panels (exterior skin), encompassed material costs exceeding 20% of the overall project expense. The indoor air quality of the Morse Courthouse is improved by the careful selection of low VOC building materials. The design team sought products meeting the standards of the South Coast Air Quality Management District Rules, Green-Seal and Green Label guidelines. To support these decisions, the majority of the flooring in the courthouse is exposed concrete, a durable material that does not negatively impact indoor air quality. To further support the indoor air quality efforts, and to reduce exposure of building occupants to potentially hazardous chemical contaminants that adversely impact air quality, occupant well being, and the environment, the Owner has enacted a comprehensive green cleaning/housekeeping program.</p>\\r\\n<p><h5>Long Life, Loose Fit</h5>\\r\\nThe most fundamentally effective way to mitigate the negative effects associated with materials and construction is to appropriately size the overall built form through careful planning and design. By combining programmatic spaces for joint use, the design minimizes individual rooms that would otherwise not be used often. Additional efficiencies were gained by minimizing the amount of program at the courtroom level. ADR suites and telephone / data rooms are placed over the courtroom sallyport area, utilizing otherwise wasted volume mandated by the courtrooms. Following multiple revisions during the design phase, the final iteration of the space program yielded efficiency ratings of 82% for the overall design, an extremely high rating for this project type. Additionally, three-dimensional coordination drawings of the various plenum spaces were generated, unveiling the fact that our plenums were oversized, and could be reduced without compromising overall clear ceiling heights. This discovery allowed two of the floors to be reduced in height by 300mm each. By installing electrical and data conduits under the raised access floor, ease of wire management was achieved, extending the life of the building and maximizing the flexibility of the spaces for future configurations without the normal costs associated with rewiring.</p>\\r\\n<p><h5>Energy Savings</h5>\\r\\nMeasurement and verification of energy efficiency is a continual process. It starts in design, where submeters are specified for specific equipment types. An M&V plan was created describing a methodology on how utility use will be monitored and evaluated. For this project, a whole building approach (IPMVP Option D) was selected to monitor the performance of the design building with respect to the baseline developed during modeling. 15-minute electric interval data is collected and made available via the web from the local utility. A sampling of lighting circuits are submetered to analyze lighting usage. Trending of HVAC equipment was also included. The results of annual performance measurements will be compiled into a report and analysis performed to ascertain actual performance. Energy Star benchmarking will be performed at the one-year mark. An annual occupant survey is a standard part of the building management protocol and is tailored to gather additional information.</p>\\r\\n", rank: 1, project_id: 553, component_type_id: 7}

With the Federal Office Building in San Francisco, Mayne proves that innovative and sustainable architecture can be introduced successfully into a building type once considered predictable and boring. In this tour of the dramatic high-rise building, Mayne takes us through the many awe-inspiring spaces, including the main lobby, upper-level offices, and an elevated outdoor bridge. During this compelling visit, the architect's engaging remarks about various green features also provide added insight into the building's inner workings.\\r\\n<br /><br />\\r\\nPRODUCER : Edgar B.

  {title: "Morphosis Exhibition Opens March 8th 2006 At The Centre Pompidou In Paris, France", description: "<p>Spectators engage the exhibit and become a part of the architecture itself by traversing the integrative glass and aluminum structure.  The exhibit components are unified under a continuous, folding glass surface; the singularity of which both mediates the spectator’s experience and enables a broader perspective. This connected isolation facilitates a unique panoramic view over a landscape of models, drawings, film, and photographs documenting ten years of Morphosis projects.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>In line with curator Frédéric Migayrou’s use of semantic mapping to frame the firm’s evolution, the array of projects is free from fixed narrative and open to a more holistic reading. As if exploring a new city, the visitor has the freedom to discover connections between projects—chronological, typological, formal, conceptual or other—and come to his or her own understanding of the body of work. The exhibit’s themes of complexity, tension, and interconnection are extensions of conceptual threads long present in the work of Morphosis.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The exhibit at the Centre Pompidou runs from March 8 – July 17, 2006. The show will travel to the Museum of Contemporary Art (MOCA) in Los Angeles, CA, where it will be on view in early 2007.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>In conjunction with the exhibit, the Centre Pompidou will release a 210-page catalog that features the collection of exhibited projects along with curator Frédéric Migayrou’s critical analysis of the firm’s architectural production.  Using techniques of semantic cartography to chart over 30 years of the firm’s output, Migayrou’s visual and conceptual analysis makes legible the complex and multivalent interconnections between projects, writings, and other cultural references. Using advanced Trope and 3D software programs, the reproductions of Morphosis projects are viewed in relationship to key visual references, which exemplify various themes from the firm’s work over thirty years: machine-like formalism, site specificity, phenomenality, connected isolation, incompleteness, social optimism, etc.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Rizzoli International Publications will simultaneously release “Fresh Morphosis: 1998 – 2004.” Fourth in a series of monographs about the firm, “Fresh Morphosis” will be exclusively released at Flammarion Livrarie, the Centre Pompidou’s bookstore, and subsequently available at bookstores internationally.</p>\\r\\n", overview: "Paris, France, March 8, 2006 – Opening at the Centre Pompidou on March 8, 2006,  “Continuities of the Incomplete” is both an exposition of Morphosis projects and itself a new work.

Lord Rogers, the architect of the Pompidou Centre in Paris, and Lord Palumbo, the property developer and art collector, felt so strongly about the inadequacies of the winning design, they submitted a \"minority report\" setting out their case to the US state department in Washington, which commissioned the building.</p>\\r\\n<p>As Susman unveiled the designs of the Philidephia-based firm of Kieran Timberlake – a 12-storey cube clad in a blastproof glass and plastic façade – it emerged the British jurors believe the Obama administration should have selected a rival design by a Californian designer, Thom Mayne, who won the Pritzker Prize, architecture's version of the Nobel, in 2005. They were overruled by the five Americans on the panel, including former ambassador Clyde Taylor.</p>\\r\\n<p>Rogers and Palumbo are said to have thought the design was boring and \"not good enough to represent one of the great nations in London\", said sources familiar with the jury process.

This book and the proposals found within, posit an alternative to traditional end-state planning solutions, while attempting to not only illuminate but also explicate Mayne’s own work and critical processes. <i>Combinatory Urbanism</i> represents a departure from previous Morphosis publications.

It's thesis strikes at the heart of what only a handful of us in the landscape world have been saying for about a decade: that the complexities of urban territories require new paradigms for thinking through systems and collective relationships beyond style, taste, individual ego, and only then will new form emerge that is smarter and reflexive and will lead us to a brighter future. Combinatory Urbanism delivers a bullseye on this message…Unlike most books of this kind, the beautiful and accessible graphics open the floodgates of ideas and breakdown the rote of daily practice. Students and general audiences of design and planning who spend time with this book will find it difficult to go back into their disciplinary silos.\"</i><br />\\r\\n--Professor Alan Berger, Massachusetts Institute of Technology\\r\\nDepartment of Urban Studies & Planning<br />\\r\\n<br />\\r\\n<i>“Combinatory Urbanism delves into armatures and manouvers which is what an urban mechanism - a city - is made up of. Looking at structure, not style, Thom Mayne and the Morphosis crew actually inhabit style - if we redefine the word to suggest invention engaging with logic. In so doing, they create new categories of 'place'.”</i><br />\\r\\n--Peter Cook<br />\\r\\n<br />\\r\\n<i>“Thom Mayne has produced a powerful view of how an architect can re-envision the city.  Combinatory Urbanism is not just an architect’s summary of his latest or greatest projects, but is a true challenge to all of us in the design community, to think differently, challenge the norms, and seek new ground in the form of open collaborations for re-envisioning the city.<br />\\r\\nThom has demonstrated remarkable leadership in the architectural design and planning community that has been generally far too silent in terms of how to direct and influence the growth of our cities and our regions.  The design community must engage in the discussion and debate.  Better cities come from many voices and many commitments.”</i> <br />\\r\\n--Philip Enquist, Partner, Skidmore, Owings & Merrill LLP<br />\\r\\n<br />\\r\\n<i>“This book is an antidote for all architects and planners who think that the new urbanism will emerge only through the deployment of historical precedent. Morphosis and Thom Mayne introduce the reader to a serious web of sharp-eyed city observations, rigorous urban research, and deeply contextual urban design programs and designs. Completed over the past decade, the twelve Morphosis projects illustrated in this book embrace the contemporary conditions of the city with optimism, projecting urban production that is simultaneously conscious infrastructure and human-centered architecture. Urban designers, planners, and architects take note. Morphosis well demonstrates that the contemporary city in all its guises deserves to benefit and prosper from the implementation of contemporary architecture.”</i><br />\\r\\n--John Kaliski, Principal, Urban Studio <br />\\r\\n<br />\\r\\n<i>“The Swiss build the Gottard tunnel;  the Chinese move the Yellow River; the Koreans suggest connecting the Han and the Nakdong; and someone whispers re-build the Mississippi Delta.  Combinatory Architecture is Combinatory Urbanism:  colossal scale; sophisticated technique;  re-imagined environments; re-invented sociologies.  Ambitious.  Complex.  And simultaneously artful.  Thom Mayne’s collective form points the circuitous way.” </i> \\r\\n<br />\\r\\n--Eric Moss, Eric Owen Moss Architects   <br />\\r\\nDirector, Southern California Institute of Architecture <br />\\r\\n<br />\\r\\n<i>“Scale is not a given, it must be invented. For too long designers have been limited by the binding restrictions of the scale we call Architecture and the scale we call Urbanism. What Mayne and Morphosis have accomplished in Combinatory Urbanism is not simply the design twelve large projects, but the invention of a new scale of design that colonizes the nebulous, unseen and largely unsuspected world that lies between buildings and cities. The projects in this book actively demonstrate the opportunities opened up by this scale, effectively recalibrating our efforts to a new design horizon. Not since Urbanisme or Learning from Las Vegas has the stakes for urban design been raised so quickly and so high.”</i><br />\\r\\n--Albert Pope, Gus Sessions Wortham Professor<br />\\r\\nRice University School of Architecture<br />\\r\\n<br />\\r\\n<i>“In his new book Combinatory Urbanism, Thom Mayne as a strategic architect shows how city planning as a discipline can be sustained for the future.<br />\\r\\nIn our complex society traditional urban planning in form of a master plan is outdated as the growth of our cities can no longer be predicted and planned. Thom Mayne re-introduces strategic paradigms into urban planning that contain more than architecture.<br />\\r\\nIn his projects new approaches in urban planning can be found through an articulated architecture that considers more than form. The 10 projects compiled in the publication show how a mix of different thought approaches produce complex solutions for a complex society. Not one language, but a multiplicity of languages that anticipate future possibilities make his solutions concrete, yet open ended and fascinating.</i><br />\\r\\n--Wolf D. Prix / COOP HIMMELB(L)AU   <br />\\r\\n<br />\\r\\n<i>“Combinatory Urbanism is a perfect example of why Thom Mayne continues to stay on the cutting edge of architecture and urban planning. From Manzanares to Manhattan, this is a blueprint for moving beyond static architecture and engineering, to the next stage of ‘dynamic urbanism.’  Educators and students alike should take note of Mayne’s innovative approach to creating a more sustainable, just, economically productive society.”</i><br />\\r\\n--Jeremy Rifkin, The Foundation on Economic Trends <br />\\r\\n<br />\\r\\n<i>\"A brilliantly imaginative book on urban planning and architecture byone of the world's greatest  living architects based on a study of 12 of his projects.<br />\\r\\nHis architecture responds to the manipulation of surfaces, forms, ridges, and valleys that dynamically interact with the needs of the sites and programs.\"</i><br />\\r\\n--Richard Rogers <br />\\r\\n<br />\\r\\n<i>“The brilliance of Morphosis’ contribution to questions of the city is the insistence on the formal core of urban practice.  Rather than seeking a series of generic solutions to problems that inevitably share common concerns – for environmental responsiveness, for social harmony, for contextual sensitivity – Morphosis always invests in a nuanced particular.

Situated amid existing canals and a new man made lake, the undulating office building interacts with an augmented ground plane, joining architecture to landscape and environment to site. \\r\\nThe East Campus office building contains three zones: open, non-hierarchical office space; private offices, and executive suites, which cantilever dramatically over the lake. Additional program is integrated into the lifted landscape, including a library, an auditorium, an exhibition space, and a café on the east campus. On the West Campus, additional program space-submerged below an expansive, undulating green roof- includes a pool, a multi-purpose sports court, and additional relaxation and fitness spaces for employees.

  {title: "Wayne Lyman Morse United States Courthouse", overview: "Repositioning Proceedings of Business as Usual<br /><br />Today, the architecture of justice drifts away from symbolic iconography; courtrooms are routinely located in generic office towers indifferent to the gravity of the judicial process. The Wayne Lyman Morse United States Courthouse challenges this trend, expressing courtrooms as discrete objects steadfast against a dynamic field of forces, recalling the historic single-room courthouse in which the court’s raison d’être was made palpable by the architecture. The Morse Courthouse expresses the stature and sobriety of the traditional courthouse in a contemporary language that makes it relevant to the present. In the form and space of the building, the legibility of the distance between the new and its historic origin physically manifests the spectrum between strict and loose interpretation, a conceptual strategy that reinforces both the necessity of persistence and the openness and freedom afforded to law and architecture by interpretation.", description: "<p>American courthouse architecture has moved away from the use of symbolic iconography to communicate the importance of the judicial process.  Courtrooms are now routinely located in generic office towers — effectively repositioning the proceedings as <em>business as usual</em> — thus obscuring the gravity of the judicial process by excising the symbolism inherent in the traditional courtroom.  The Eugene Federal Courthouse seeks to challenge this trend by expressing the courtrooms as discrete object buildings — a reference back to an earlier single room courthouse model.  The building is composed of two distinct strata, the honorific and the quotidian. The iconic elements are the courtrooms themselves, located in articulated pavilions that float above an orthogonal two-story plinth that houses office and administrative spaces. Their forms refer to the fluid nature of the American Judicial System — a system that is designed to remain flexible by being continuously challenged and reinterpreted by the proceedings of the courts. The formal and structural organization of the plinth is mimetic of the Cartesian layout of the city, and thus represents the more static nature of Eugene’s urban fabric upon which the organic and independent shapes of the courthouses rest.</p><p>Ribbons of steel envelop the pavilions, articulating the movement sequence between the three courtroom clusters. The waiting areas and public corridors that connect the courtroom pavilions provide views to the surrounding mountains and a perception of light and the passage of time. The entry occurs at the moment where the two systems collide, in a large open atrium, framed by the base’s strict grid and sculpted by the fluid forms above.</p><p>The shapes of the pavilions emanate from the autonomous courtrooms themselves, whose soft forms are constricted to direct the focus to the witness stand and judge's bench. The jury boxes are partially recessed, isolated in an articulated space that refers to the juror’s role as both observer and participant. In the courtrooms, natural light is admitted through two thick-walled, large apertures above the judge’s bench.  The effect is that of a freestanding building, a unique and dignified place in which the court’s raison d’être is architecturally legible.</p>", program: "Six federal courtrooms with judge's chambers, support offices, lobby, jury assembly areas and cafeteria", client: "GSA Northwest Region 10", size: 270000, site_area: nil, lat: nil, lon: nil, street_address: "405 East 8th Avenue", zip: nil, design_sdate: "1999-01-01", design_edate: "2004-01-01", constr_sdate: "2004-01-01", constr_edate: "2006-01-01", open_date: nil, close_date: nil, section_id: 1, height: nil, hit: 33726, city: "Eugene", state: "Oregon", country: "United States of America"},
  {title: "Phare Tower", overview: "Synthesizing Idiosyncrasies to Mend a Site<br /><br />Drawing on the power of parametric scripting, the design of the Phare Tower gathers disparate programmatic, physical, and infrastructural elements from the requirements of the building and its surrounding context, and synthesizes these into a form that seamlessly integrates the building into  the idiosyncrasies of its site while expressing multiple flows of movement. In the spirit of the Paris Exposition competition proposals, the tower embodies state-of-the-art technological advances to become a cultural landmark.<br /><br />The complex structure and skin adapt to the tower’s nonstandard form while simultaneously responding to a range of complex, and often competing, physical and environmental considerations. Technologies integrated into the Phare Tower capture the wind for the production of energy and selectively minimize solar gain while maximizing glare-free daylight. Its high-performance skin transforms with changes in light, becoming opaque, translucent, or transparent from different angles and vantage points.", description: "<p>Between 1958 and 1989, high-rise buildings (banned in the historic center of Paris) were constructed just outside the city boundary, forming the business district of La Défense two miles west of Paris. The Phare Tower (phare being French for beacon or lighthouse) marks the first stage of a major redevelopment of the district. La Défense is currently a zone of discrete, isolated buildings amid blank plazas—essentially a nonsite. </p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The tower emerges from its irregular site, defined by a neighboring motorway and a rail link, and bisected by an existing pedestrian walkway. It is located between the 1989 Grande Arche de la Défense and the 1958 CNIT building, the former exhibition hall of the National Inter-University Consortium for Telecommunications, with an architecturally significant glass façade, designed by Jean Prouvé. These disparate elements, crowded together and seemingly unrelated, provide an opportunity to mend the site. The site strategy thus synthesizes the programmatic, physical, and infrastructural complexities to connect the surrounding urban space and create a coherent sense of place where none previously existed. </p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>At the levels of urbanism and circulation, the scheme complements existing plans to transform the CNIT into a center for commerce and recreation. Circulation is directed from the existing transit hub below grade, through the renovated CNIT facilities, and into the tower’s public spaces via a pavilion. The pavilion connects to the Place Carpeaux, and transitions from horizontal to vertical, becoming an integral element in the tower’s form. Glazed exterior escalators soar 35 meters from the pavilion to the tower’s ninth-floor lobby, transporting approximately eight thousand pedestrians each day. As the visitor rides up the escalators to the Grand Hall, the fully glazed envelope reveals views of the traffic passing underneath, as well as of Parisian monuments in the distance. </p>{break}\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Rather than an isolated and autonomous tower, the building is a hybrid structure. The 300-meter tower straddles the site to meet the ground as a tripod. It comprises one splayed structural leg, two occupiable legs (the Trapezium, to the west, and the East Building), as well as a pavilion that engages the surrounding context and transforms the public space of the plaza. The two occupiable legs frame a 24-meter-wide by-28-meter-tall void in the tower’s base, creating a monumental urban gateway, which maintains view corridors toward the CNIT and toward Courbevoie and allows pedestrian traffic to flow directly underneath the building. </p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>As it rises from its tripod base, the tower’s asymmetric profile swells slightly to accommodate the soaring Grand Hall, then becomes more slender in response to wind load, and finally tapers off to a thicket of wind turbines, antennas and hair-like structures on the roof. The tower appears to shift continually, distinct from different vantage points—not a single image but a dynamic structure that responds to its site, environment, and performance requirements. At its base, the building’s skin opens, exposing a 250-foot-high Grand Hall. The Grand Hall becomes the center for all vertical transportation. From the Hall’s security checkpoint, people transition to double-deck banks of express elevators serving the office tower. On the 66th floor, a sky restaurant and a panoramic terrace, offering spectacular 270-degree views, are open to the public. Overall, the project comprises 146 988m<sup>2</sup> or 1 582 166 ft<sup>2</sup> of net surface area and 164 185 m<sup>2</sup> or 1 767 273 ft<sup>2</sup> of gross surface area.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Technologies integrated into the Phare Tower harness the wind for the production of energy and selectively minimize solar gain while maximizing glare-free daylight.

A curvilinear second skin of  diagonal stainless steel mesh panels wraps the tower’s continuous south, east, and west glazed façades to minimize heat gain and glare and maximize energy efficiency. </p>", program: "Commercial office tower with office space, employee restaurants, public cafés and amenities, panoramic restaurant", client: "SCI CNIT DEVELOPPEMENT", size: 1767273, site_area: "0.8", lat: "48.894094", lon: "2.238191", street_address: "", zip: nil, design_sdate: "2006-01-01", design_edate: "2010-01-01", constr_sdate: nil, constr_edate: nil, open_date: nil, close_date: nil, section_id: 1, height: nil, hit: 141730, city: "La Defense", state: nil, country: "France"},
  {title: "41 Cooper Square", overview: "A stacked vertical piazza, organized around a central atrium to encourage social exchange", description: "41 Cooper Square, the new academic building for The Cooper Union, aspires to manifest the character, culture and vibrancy of both the 150 year-old institution and of the city in which it was founded. Dedicated to Peter Cooper’s vision that education leads to civic, cultural and practicable enrichment, the institution has subsequently grown to become a renowned intellectual and cultural center for the City of New York. 41 Cooper Square aspires to reflect the institution’s stated goal to create an iconic building – one that reflects its values and aspirations as a center for advanced and innovative education in Art, Architecture and Engineering.<br /><br />  \\r\\nInternally, the building is conceived as a vehicle to foster collaboration and cross-disciplinary dialogue among the college’s three schools, previously housed in separate buildings. A vertical piazza—the central space for informal social, intellectual and creative exchange—forms the heart of the new academic building.  An undulating lattice envelopes a 20-foot wide grand stair which ascends four stories from the ground level through the sky-lit central atrium, which itself reaches to the full height of the building.  This vertical piazza is the social heart of the building, providing a place for impromptu and planned meetings, student gatherings, lectures, and for the intellectual debate that defines the academic environment.<br /><br />\\r\\nFrom the double-high entry lobby, the grand stair ascends four stories to terminate in a glazed double-high student lounge overlooking the city. On the fifth through ninth floors, sky lobbies and meeting places—including a student lounge, seminar rooms, lockers, and seating areas overlooking the cityscape—are organized around the central atrium.  Sky bridges span the atrium to create connections between these informal spaces.   Further reinforcement of the strategy to create a vibrant intellectual space is provided by the “skip-stop” circulation strategy which allows for both increased physical activity and for more impromptu meeting opportunities. The primary skip-stop elevators, which make stops at the first, fifth and eighth floors, encourage occupants to use the grand stairs and sky bridges.  Secondary elevators stop at each floor, both for ADA compliance and for the practical tasks of moving materials, artworks, and equipment.<br /> <br /> \\r\\nIn the spirit of the institution’s dedication to free, open and accessible education, the building itself is symbolically open to the city. Visual transparencies and accessible public spaces connect the institution to the physical, social and cultural fabric of its urban context. At street level, the transparent facade invites the neighborhood to observe and to take part in the intensity of activity contained within. Many of the public functions - an exhibition gallery, board room and a two-hundred-seat auditorium - are easily accessible one level below grade.<br />\\r\\n<br /> \\r\\nThe building reverberates with light, shadow and transparency via a high performance exterior double skin whose semi-transparent layer of perforated stainless steel wraps the building’s glazed envelope to provide critical interior environmental control, while also allowing for transparencies to reveal the creative activity occurring within. Responding to its urban context, the sculpted facade establishes a distinctive identity for Cooper Square. The building’s corner entry lifts up to draw people into the lobby in a deferential gesture towards the institution’s historic Foundation Building.  The façade registers the iconic, curving profile of the central atrium as a glazed figure that appears to be carved out of the Third Avenue façade, connecting the creative and social heart of the building to the street.<br /><br /> \\r\\n41 Cooper Square is the first LEED-certified academic laboratory building in New York City.  With a Platinum rating, the project's advanced green building initiatives include:<br /><br />\\r\\n•\tAn operable building skin made of perforated stainless steel panels offset from a glass and aluminum window wall. The panels reduce the impact of heat radiation during the summer and insulate interior spaces during the winter.<br /><br /> \\r\\n•\tRadiant heating and cooling ceiling panels introduce innovative HVAC technology that will boost energy efficiency. This contributes to making the new building 40 percent more energy efficient than a standard building of its type.<br /><br />  \\r\\n•\tA full-height atrium enables unique circulation for building occupants, improves the flow of air and provides increased interior day lighting.<br /><br />\\r\\n•\tSeventy-five percent of the building’s regularly occupied spaces are lit by natural daylight.<br /><br />\\r\\n•\tA green roof insulates the building, reduces city “heat island” effect, storm water runoff and pollutants; harvested water is reused.<br /><br />\\r\\n•\tA cogeneration plant provides additional power to the building, recovers waste heat and effectively cuts energy costs.<br /><br />\\r\\n•\tFlexible state-of-the-art laboratories, studios and classrooms are specifically designed to accommodate pedagogical objectives, as well as current and future research activities.<br /><br />\\r\\nThis aggregation of progressive green building initiatives combines with the building’s social spaces and urban connectivity to support Cooper Union in advancing its legacy of innovative ideas, cross-disciplinary knowledge, and creative practices well into the future. \\r\\n\\r\\n<br/><br/>\\r\\nTime-lapse video of 41 Cooper Square construction: \\r\\n\\r\\n<object width=\"480\" height=\"385\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/vrPS8chBeFU&hl=en_US&fs=1&rel=0\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/vrPS8chBeFU&hl=en_US&fs=1&rel=0\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"480\" height=\"385\"></embed></object>\\r\\n", program: "Academic and laboratory building with exhibition gallery, auditorium, lounge and multi-purpose space, and retail space", client: "The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art", size: 175000, site_area: "0.41", lat: nil, lon: nil, street_address: "41 Cooper Square", zip: 10003, design_sdate: "2004-01-01", design_edate: "2006-01-01", constr_sdate: "2006-01-01", constr_edate: "2009-01-01", open_date: nil, close_date: nil, section_id: 1, height: nil, hit: 195994, city: "New York City", state: "New York", country: "United States of America"},

The interior bamboo garden, pierced midway up by skywalks and punctuated with meeting spaces is meant to bring a piece of nature into this somewhat blighted inner city environment.  It is possible, once the bamboo is fully grown to find a space of respite among the plants or to use areas carved into the midst of the planted space as an experiential teaching opportunity.</p><p>The new North building burrows into sculpted earthworks along Exposition Boulevard; its landscaped roof is perceptually an extension of the garden. Classrooms are grouped in clusters of four that share a common room, to provide an open and flexible teaching environment.  In response to the Exposition Park master plan and to highlight the historic Armory, this “non-building” nestles into excavated land below grade, its program essentially tucked and embedded into the park.  The structure emerges quietly from the adjacent Rose Garden — a welcoming and protective environment for children that has forgone the traditionally overt sense of enclosure of most public schools.

  {title: "University of Cincinnati Campus Recreation Center", overview: "Weaving as a Means for Establishing Flow<br /><br />The Campus Recreation Center at the University of Cincinnati ties together incongruous buildings into a unified expression. Both keystone and connector, the building encourages social exchange and harnesses flows onto the campus green. Appropriating and magnifying specific site conditions, the project taps the potential energy of found material. Its formal genesis is a result of programmatic superimposition and found site conditions–relationships to surrounding buildings, ground formation, and directional flows. The building is grounded in its context yet monumental in stature, a physical phenomenon and a cultural artifact. Negotiating between local specificity and universal idealism, the recreation center is both background and foreground–a fabric building become infrastructure that connects and <em>provokes</em>.", description: "<p>Weaving as a means of establishing flow to resolve the site’s disparate staccato of existing buildings and edges informs the principal strategy for the University of Cincinnati master plan.  We were interested in developing a series of connective events to engage peripheral flows on the campus in order to generate or augment an urban density and to encourage, rather than dampen, the polyvalent nature of social experience on campus.</p> <p>Forms reflect found conditions and contribute to a strategy for cohesively incorporating numerous existing structures with the additional 350,000 square feet of recreational facilities, classrooms, housing, campus store, dining hall, and varsity aquatic center, that are included in this new facility.  Conceiving the main circulation corridor as a series of weaving strands, we placed “Main Street,” the primary campus thoroughfare, in such a way as to concentrate and direct the movement of students. The contoured element of the new housing building funnels students onto the campus green, feeding the force-field of movement through a “pinch point.” Secondary pedestrian paths penetrate, intertwine, and wrap buildings, further relaxing a reading of discrete objects on a homogenous field, and substituting a thick mat of cohesive trajectories in its place.</p><p>Augmented ground has been an evolving interest in our studio; here a thickened ground mat becomes a means of adding program to site.

The San Francisco Federal Building offers a frank, contemporary response to its context, but more importantly it establishes a benchmark for sustainable design in its use of natural energy sources. During the design process, we learned that the same decisions that maximize energy efficiency could also help create a high-quality workspace that redefines bureaucratic culture. The building physically democratizes the workplace as it enhances health and comfort and empowers its users with a sense of control over their surroundings.", description: "<blockquote>…without an active sidewalk life, without the frequent, serendipitous interactions of many people, ‘there is no public acquaintanceship, no foundation of public trust, no cross connections with the necessary people – and no practice or ease in applying the most ordinary techniques of public life at lowly levels.’</blockquote>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>—Malcolm Gladwell on Jane Jacobs’ The Death and Life of Great American Cities. From “Designs for Working” New Yorker December 11, 2000, pages 60–70.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Broadly understood, the project has developed around three primary objectives: the establishment of a benchmark for sustainable building design through the efficient use of natural energy sources; the redefinition of the culture of the workplace through office environments that boost workers’ health, productivity, and creativity; and the creation of an urban landmark that engages with the community.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>A slender 18–story tower punctuates the skyline, and a public plaza and four–story annex connect to the scale and fabric of the city. The large, open plaza at the intersection of Mission and 7th is a valuable asset in the South-of-Market district, identified by the city as deficient in public space. The placement of the free standing cafeteria pavilion and the public nature of the facilities housed within the tower’s lower levels (including a conference center, fitness center, and daycare center for both local residents and employees) enliven the urban plaza with a steady stream of visitors.</p>{break}\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The re–definition of circulation and vertical movement paths provides opportunities for chance encounters, a critical mass in circulation, and places for employees to gather across the typical confines of cubicles, departments, or floor plates. The democratic layout locates open work areas at the building perimeter and private offices and conference spaces at the central cores. As Gladwell’s article points out, “…one study after another has demonstrated [that] the best ideas in any workplace arise out of casual contact among different groups within the same company.” Skip stop elevators, sky gardens, tea salons, large open stairs, flexible floor plans, and the elimination of corner offices endow the tower with a Jacobsian “sidewalk life” of cross-sectional interactions.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Many of the same design decisions that create high quality workspace also maximize energy efficiency. The Federal Building is the first office tower in the U.S. to forgo air-conditioning in favor of natural ventilation.

  {title: "Madrid Housing", overview: "A Typology of Porosity to Realize Social Ideals<br /><br />The model we developed in the Madrid Public Housing, located in the PAU of Carabanchel, provides a responsive alternative to conventional housing blocks. Instead of a rigid tower structure essentially owned by no one, we suggested that a rhythmic structure would better resonate with the patterns of a neighborhood. With various levels of social association, communication, and organization, the scheme is simple, respectful of traditional dwelling customs, and flexible enough to be updated and altered as needed or desired. Changing the typology of housing is a slow process; however, it is faster and more effective than changing an entire New Town configuration.<br /><br />Breaking down the institutional nature of the public housing project, the basic parti is a low-rise J form in section, arranged in series of spaces to evoke a village. Loggias and green spaces for the domestically scaled massing afford community-oriented amenities, with private and public courtyards interacting through shared views.

Relieved of its obligation to serve as an institutional symbol, the Hypo bank headquarters is free to engage the specificity of context, climate, and environment with acute agility, resulting in a new icon for the bank, one that does not represent power or stability but instead responds constructively to its context. Following the line of inquiry of the earlier Hypo bank project outside Klagenfurt, Austria, the Udine, Italy, building is part “earth building,” engaging its contoured landscape, and part tower, leaning fourteen degrees to the south to shade itself from harsh solar exposure. Its form mediates between building, landscape, and climate, and thus it integrates the inherent complexities at the edge city’s shifting relations to the local, the rural, the suburban, the urban, and the metropolitan.", description: "<p>Located at the northern edge of Udine, in the town of Tavagnacco, the new headquarters for Hypo-Alpe-Adria Italy has developed as a dynamic and nuanced response to program and site. In this dialectical relationship between the specific architectural language of the project and the local landscape, each element informs, transforms, and adjusts the total composition. The result is a richly developed series of spaces and building elements.</p><h5>The Masterplan</h5><p>Following the dictates of the program, the site is configured as an interwoven series of building components. Each of these individual parts is carefully organized around an elongated driveway, knitting together the disparate corners of the site. The overall effect is a wholly new precinct for Tavagnacco -- one that fulfills the functional and symbolic requirements of the Hypo bank while serving the nearby neighborhood with a series of public amenities. The centerpiece of the compositional strategy is the Hypo bank headquarters, located adjacent to the Tangenziale di Udine and immediately to the west of the autostrada. Occupying the extreme northeastern parcel of the 26-acre site, the bank building rises seven stories, an iconic landmark anchor for the site, highly visible and instantly recognizable from each approach. Various components of the banking facility are arrayed about the base of the building: a long sweeping low mass containing the secure archive wraps the surface parking lot to the east, while the auditorium and branch bank are located in order to establish a clear, legible, and secure public entry to the Hypo headquarters.</p><p>Various other program elements occupy the entire western edge of the site. At the southernmost location, the pool and fitness center form an integrated complex of buildings and outdoor spaces. In its overall architectural disposition, the pool simultaneously engages the neighborhood and public park to the south, as well as reaching back towards the Hypo headquarters in a strong diagonal gesture.</p>{break}<h5>The Headquarters</h5><p>The new Hypo headquarters has been designed to reflect intelligent planning and efficiency from the outset, to achieve effective utilization of the floor area and the integration of critical engineering parameters and performance objectives. The unique form of the building relies upon the adherence to a 14 m. building width -- an exceptionally narrow floorplate, which still allows for a very efficient space planning layout. The other advantages of the narrow floorplate include ample access to natural daylight and the benefits of crossventilation through operable windows.</p><p>The Hypo headquarters embodies broad goals for the typology of the progressive office building. Broadly understood, three primary organizing concepts informed the design of the building:</p><p>• <em>the social life of the building:</em> The environment throughout the building provides a rich and complex series of spaces to support chance encounters and interaction between all users of the building. Program elements are located to support and enhance the varied, informal dimension without any compromise to the working environment. The building footprint optimizes use of space and provides highly favorable ratios of useable to gross area.</p><p>• <em>the movement system:</em> The path of movement through the building is one of the most unique aspects of the new headquarters, with a continuous space at the central core that rises dramatically, crossed by stairs and bridges, and naturally lit from above.</p><p>• <em>the working office environment:</em> At its heart, the new Hypo headquarters has been designed around the health, happiness, and productivity of the working population of the building. As such, each office in the building is afforded a view to the exterior and operable windows that allow for individual control of the environment. The generous office environment is filled with fresh air and natural daylight.</p><h5>Engineering</h5><p>In keeping with a general commitment to the logical integration of technical building systems and enhancing energy conservation, the engineering solutions address overall performance and efficiency. As in all of our work, the key to the performance diagram derives from the integration of engineering systems into the building at the first stages of the design. Working with the IN.AR.CO engineering group, our team developed the optimal solutions for the headquarters.</p><p>Structurally, the building derives great benefit from a simple repetitive system of gravity columns and shear walls incorporated into the building core. Though the building form is leaning to the south by 14 degrees, the columns are continuous and vertical throughout the structural frame. This strategy achieves a dramatic and unexpected architectural expression, with a minimum of additional cost and construction difficulty, and no loss in program efficiency. The structural offset for the building also allows the upper floors to provide solar shading for the lower levels of the building during the hotter summer months.</p><p>The typical structural module is 8 m. x 6.5 m, and the concrete floor system utilizes a simple two-way flat slab construction, approximately 250 mm thick. The floor slab edges are cantilevered beyond the column line to define the 14 m. width of the building. The typical floor-to-floor dimension of 4 m. provides a spatially generous working environment, good opportunities for distribution of indirect light, and ample space for incorporation of mechanical and utilities. The performance of the buildingâ€™s exterior envelope is maximized, supporting the engineering goals. As in previous Morphosis projects, the exterior envelope employs passive and active sunshading, in order to minimize solar heat gain without reducing the transmission of daylight below a useable level, or compromising the view for the office occupants.</p>", program: "Bank headquarters building with administrative offices, bank branch, archive, municipal swimming pool, and kindergarten", client: "Hypo Alpe-Adria Bank", size: 171150, site_area: "26.0", lat: nil, lon: nil, street_address: "Via Alpe Adria 6", zip: nil, design_sdate: "2003-01-01", design_edate: "2004-01-01", constr_sdate: "2004-01-01", constr_edate: "2006-01-01", open_date: nil, close_date: nil, section_id: 1, height: nil, hit: 23481, city: "Tavagnacco", state: "Udine", country: "Italy"},

A grove of newly planted sycamore trees, part of the overall landscape strategy, create a natural but permeable boundary. The new building extends a primary north-south axis across California Boulevard, stitching the two campuses together. A series of north-south interior corridors—literally, “stitches”—reinforce this connection and serve to orient circulation.

  {title: "Crawford Residence", overview: "", description: "<p>The Crawford Residence was situated outside of an urban context, on the slope of an irregular hillside near Santa Barbara. The site has a relationship to both mountains and ocean. Our modus operandi in this instance took the form of excavation, digging into and sculpting the earth long before any structure was elaborated. Inspired by earth artists such as Michael Heizer and Robert Smithson, we began to explore a new interaction with topography and to challenge the object nature of the work. Molding the land, we took an intuitive, reflexive approach, subtracting the surface and thereby creating rhythmic patterns and oscillations of scale. This strategy was then augmented by a rigorous method of measuring the site, which remains evident in the concrete totems, a series of voids, and the heterogeneous organization of the final structure. In elaborating the building out of this complex interplay with the site, we dispensed with a notion of center or any single point of reference. Instead, the peripheral organization enhances a sense of dispersal, the building breaks up into a series of fragments, ascending or embedding themselves within the hillside. From within, the house is experienced through an enhanced perception of multidimensionality.</p>\\r\\n<br />\\r\\n<p>In the end, however, the initial conceptual apparatus had to come to terms with programmatic concerns and the clients' more traditional desires in terms of a domestic language.

  {title: "Manzanares River Park Development", overview: "", description: "<p>Madrid, geographic center of the Iberian Peninsula and Spain’s capital city since 1562, is currently experiencing a renewed commitment to urban revitalization and enhancement. The Rio Manzanares Recuperacion Margenes park project exemplifies this effort. Framed as a reclamation and transformation of the Rio Manzanares and its edges, the project will result in a 7.6 kilometer Linear Park that aspires to be a draw for the city’s inhabitants and a vibrant new urban amenity in what will have once been an underutilized and neglected area of the city.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Our master plan scheme recognizes the significance of this revitalization effort and its potential to be a catalyst for the rejuvenation of surrounding neighborhoods.  Situated just outside the old city adjacent to the historic Calle de Toledo, our project proposes an innovative 21st century urban environment that will become the keystone of redevelopment along Rio Manzanares, a connection between the new river corridor and the city, and an expression of the vision behind the river’s transformation. Through thoughtful intervention and creative development, the URM project will capitalize on this unique opportunity to transform the historic perception of the river and its neighboring areas as barrier into an experience of the river and its neighboring areas as conduit or connective tissue that links together disjointed parts of the city.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Broadly understood, the URM project has developed around three primary principles or objectives:</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>•   Informed by a belief in the city as both expression of and armature for collective human experience, the project proposes a systemic strategy for urban development that is integrative and holistic in approach and that, like the city itself, emphasizes the importance of the whole and the interdependence of its parts;</p>\\r\\n{break}\\r\\n<p>•   This systemic approach facilitates development of a design that amplifies the positive impact and resonance of the Rio Manzanares Recuperacion Margenes park project by forging increased connectivity and accessibility between the river, the Park, the city center and outlying areas, yielding a generative tissue—or architectural DNA—that stimulates further sympathetic development along the Rio Manzanares and in the city of Madrid;</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>•   This increased connectivity and accessibility enables the development of an armature for a rich and inclusive urban experience that provides inhabitants of the city with a diverse mix of natural, civic and cultural amenities.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>All of these objectives are interrelated and realized in a design that will achieve a complete integration of program, architecture, urban design, and context all woven into a seamless whole.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>URBAN ORGANIZATION</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>A systemic strategy</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Ours is a systemic approach that builds upon organizational and spatial principles that are integrative and connective—quite the opposite of what one finds in a typical development of this nature.  Distinct from a suburban model, which estranges the domestic from the public sphere, our design creates a new multivalent, living urban space that will provide its users with the stimulation and sensory richness that so defines the urban experience of Madrid.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Our design capitalizes on the unique attributes of the site: its waterfront, its hillside character and its surrounding context. By working deliberately to sculpt land and building forms into a coherent relationship with the existing urban fabric and by responding to the naturally advantageous site conditions, our scheme prioritizes open space  and creates a multi-layered, three-dimensional urban organization that emphasizes connectivity and the symbiotic interaction between water, landscape, building, and program.  By integrating zones typically thought of as discrete, water forms, landforms, built forms and program work together to form a hybridized contemporary vision for a new urban typology.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Inherent in our systemic approach is the provision of a flexible framework that recognizes and facilitates the fluid nature of a development of this scale and complexity. While the project provides a comprehensive vision, it has also been conceived as an eminently flexible and divisible system that can adjust in response to changing programmatic needs, market demands, and economic forces without compromising the project’s integrity, quality and character.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>Flows and Steps</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Two complementary and interdependent organizational systems influence and direct the overall framework and formal character of the project “Flows,” or deliberately defined and distributed streams of open space and circulation corridors,  take their cue from the meandering river itself and metaphorically extend the river and the park into the site and beyond. “Steps,” or terraced passages, work in conjunction and harmony with the “flows,” ordering and rationalizing their more organic nature with a system that references the gridded urban fabric of Madrid into the site.  Together, these systems provide a strategy for manipulating both built form and terrain, negotiating a synergistic relationship between River and City and establishing a framework to accommodate a variety of uses.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Flows and steps guide, influence and direct pedestrian and vehicular circulation, built form, program distribution and landscape integration, establishing continuous, uninterrupted access, experience and use of the newly developed area. The demarcation of flows and steps facilitates a range of options for traversing the site: Pathways wind along the Manzanares Park; hybrid bridge buildings provide conduits across the river; broad green spaces and open spaces enable movement and recreation; compressed circulation defines the vibrant urban experience of the central plaza; stepped corridors ease movement up the sloped hillside site into the adjacent neighborhoods, towards the historical city center and back again.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>Integration and Connectivity</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>URM establishes many levels of connection with the surrounding context and greater Madrid, positioning the project as both destination and journey.  Our scheme creates a focal node at the center of the proposed linear park, pulling green space from the waterfront into the site, towards the Puerta de Toledo and the old city beyond. The project’s perimeter buildings frame the existing avenues and are scaled to complement the surrounding residential context. At ground level, a rich mix of residential, retail, and service spaces activate the streetscape and integrate with the surrounding neighborhood. Our design constructs organizations and structures that promote social interaction without compromising the sanctity of the individual dwelling. Strategically located and articulated circulation paths/streets, urban plazas, and green space provide important informal and formal gathering spaces that cultivate a sense of community. \\r\\nAmenities \\r\\nThe URM project proposes a rich and inclusive urban experience whose character will enhance and complement the surrounding context of Madrid. Our holistic understanding of interrelationships between programmatic zones maximizes advantageous use of the site. This dynamic urban destination will be characterized by dense, mixed-use programs strategically distributed to maximize connectivity, integration and shared use of civic and cultural amenities. This heterogeneous and synergistic blend of building, program and landscape are created at a variety of densities and scales to define the project and correspond with the site’s unique attributes: its topography, its river front, and its rich urban texture.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Our site strategy balances open space with dense concentrations of cultural, residential, commercial and educational development as follows: \\r\\nOpen Space \\r\\nIn an effort to strengthen the new development’s connection to the surrounding context, our design prioritizes open space as a first principle and bequeaths upon the community three primary zones and several varieties of public space:\\r\\n•   A public green and destination park along the riverfront accommodates civic and cultural uses  and seamlessly connects to and extends the City’s linear park; \\r\\n•   An urban plaza at the center of the site providing an open space typology that is familiar and reminiscent of plazas elsewhere in the city; \\r\\n•   Beyond the urban plaza and serving the upper developmental zone is a terraced public green space that faces the Plaza de Francisco Morano and the Puerta de Toledo beyond, further connecting the URM development with the existing urban fabric of Madrid.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Weaving through, around and under the buildings, the open spaces are conceived as an extension of and gateway to both the Rio Manzanares and the city center. These open spaces serve as connective tissue that ties the project’s residential, commercial, cultural and civic uses into a singular and cohesive whole, accommodating both active and passive occupation of the site.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>Cultural</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Complementing and working in tandem with the public/open space, this project conceives a series of cultural zones and  buildings as gifts to the city. Most prominent are the two hybrid bridge-buildings that span the Rio Manzanares. These bridge-buildings demarcate and appropriate a swath of land on the river’s edges, which in conjunction with the bridges provide an armature for cultural program.  Possible attractions for this cultural park include exhibition space, restaurants, cafes, seating areas and a water park.  Bounded by the bridges, the public green at the bend in the Rio Manzanares is complemented by a reflecting pool and designed water feature that pulls the river into the site establishing a controlled edge and recreation zone for adjacent residents and inhabitants of the city at large.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>Residential & Commercial</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>A combination of low-rise and tower typologies allow us to prioritize open space and connectivity while generating a diverse and varied urban fabric rich with spatial, aesthetic and experiential possibilities. Residential “ribbon” buildings weave through the site, define its boundaries and relate to the scale of the surrounding residential neighborhood. \\r\\nTwo towers—one residential and one office—punctuate the contextual perimeter buildings at the curve in the Rio Manzanares and at the project’s urban entry point, strategically located to capitalize on site and topography. A commercial galleria, framed by public plazas at each end, anchors the site at the river’s edge and doubles as connective device and circulation corridor that encourages pedestrian flows through the site.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>Educational</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>One of our first priorities is to build a new school on the site. Inspired by our longstanding commitment to education and interest in the pedagogical impact of architecture as a social agenda, we will endeavor to develop a school that stimulates and inspires learning and curiosity. The new facility will replace an existing school building that is currently located in the center of the proposed development and that is being moved from its current location in order to establish fluid, uninterrupted connectivity between the upper and lower development zones of the URM. The new facility will expand the school’s functionality, increase student capacity and enhance the educational environment. In addition to providing a state of the art facility, the new school zone will provide students with access to a protected green space that will be exclusively prioritized for school use.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>INTEGRATING SUSTAINABLE DESIGN</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Our scheme envisions a community that functions as a “living machine” by incorporating a range of low energy, high environmental quality planning and design initiatives and ecologically responsive landscapes. Ours is a holistic design approach that prioritizes and optimizes quality of life for occupants and users and strives to contribute to the conservation of the environment through the intelligent utilization of resources.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>PHASING</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>While we have designed the scheme as an integrated system, we have strategically considered the logistics of phased construction and distributed ownership.

Upon visiting our exhibition at the Netherlands Institute of Architecture (NAI), Flamand sensed a connection between our interests and his “concern of confronting dance with an architecture of transformation and metamorphoses.” Both the title of Silent Collisions and its architectonic concept are siblings of our NAI installation, which, over the course of an hour, transformed dramatically at a nearly imperceptible pace.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Italo Calvino’s text Invisible Cities serves as a program for our concepts, an initiator of ideas about movement and spatial configurations. As a formal and temporal symmetry device, the structure starts and ends as a platonic form—a cube. Throughout the performance, the planes of the cube fold up or down to animate the environment. One specific city from each of Calvino’s eleven archetypes inspires a dance piece, which occurs amid a unique configuration of the architecture on stage. For example, the configuration for Cities and the Sky—Eudoxia derives from Calvino’s description of the city, “which spreads both upward and down, with winding alleys, steps, dead ends, hovels, [where] a carpet is preserved in which you can observe the city’s true form.” The stage structure opens up completely, making way for the projection of an imaginary carpet on the ground.

The well-established strategy of transferring air rights allows the zoning envelope for each building site to evolve beyond a simple vertical extrusion of the site’s footprint, to facilitate a network of interlocking forms reminiscent of the venerated Chinese puzzle. The scheme questions the appropriateness of creating a field of disassociated vertical skyscrapers on the site, in favor of creating a cohesive, interwoven district. The tower—conventionally thought of as an isolated, autonomous object—is now rooted in a new urban fabric, interwoven with fluid built forms and vibrant civic spaces. Rather than considering each individual tower as its own discrete icon, the scheme conceives the entire Financial District as a new type of icon—a district with its own unique character amidst the greater city of Shenzhen—that will be recognized the world over.

The intent of our proposal was to develop a library that would hover between figure (object: sacred and honorific) and ground (contextual: profane and accessible). The idea was generated outward from an idealized core to the specificity of program and site. The core had two parts: a solid (the open access areas of the main public reading room), and a void (the courtyard responding to the “force” of the Friedrichstrasse axis, maintaining its historic continuity despite the existence of the Wall). The positioning of the new complex was intended simultaneously to reinforce and reinterpret the original architectural strategy, it consequently could have been read as a single building. The peripheral parts of the new project were concerned with connection and definition. Our goals were to 1) open the line of axis to Mehringplats, 2) make Blucherplatz a space compatible with the new complex, 3) de-scale Blucherstrasse and make an overt connection to the block configuration of the Hertie Department Store, 4) formulate a strong optical relationship between Blucherplatz and the Church zum Heiligen Kreuz, and 5) maintain the relationship between the garden, the existing reading room, and the view to the cemetery from the office block.<br /><br />\\r\\n\\r\\nThe existing park was augmented by fragments of old and new (historical traces and the new project). The major architectural gesture was an arcade of trees (borrowing and reiterating the formal idea of the original library) disposed to define and focus on the physical and social relationship with the Church zum Heiligen Kreuz. The trees extended the geometry of the children’s library (literally in the park) which was positioned as a fragment of an earth berm and was open to a private courtyard. Newly defined paths along urban block configurations and fragments of the new building formed places (individual and social); both were intended to make the park transitional.<br /><br />\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a direct relationship between the urban intentions and the internal functioning of the new complex. The proposed addition was to enhance one’s comprehension of location and choice of movement within a complex, multi-departmental facility. The new pedestrian circulation system was to be linear and perpendicular to the Friedrichstrasse axis; it was predicated on one’s perception of the court’s formal termination of Friedrichstrasse. The entrance was to have been on the western edge of this court and was accessed via Blucherplatz, the two-story arcade defining Blucherstrasse, or the stairwell connecting the proposed new subterranean public parking.\\r\\n{break}\\r\\n<br /><br />\\r\\n\\r\\nThe major new space of the library (its core) was designed to be a “cathedral of knowledge.” Suspended rooms, composed of four departments stacked vertically, made up the upper volume of this space.

  {title: "Museo del Prado Competition", overview: "", description: "The Prado National Museum in Madrid is one of Spain’s most revered public institutions and an internationally renowned destination for large numbers of tourists and scholars. The building is a traditional model of a museum — a palace for art — and is one of the few museums in the world where the art and the building are thought of together as a single entity, like the Louvre. Over time, the open space around the villa has been slowly absorbed by the city with only residual fragments remaining. To make the expansion possible, the museum administration added a site directly behind the existing building, connected to a cloister. The competition rules dictated that the cloister was to remain intact while the other two existing buildings were to be connected to form a large museum complex. Our approach was to reinforce the existing building rather than confront it, by focusing on landscape as a foreground for a construction that allowed an understanding of the original building. We also understood that the important focal point would not be Goya, but rather the far more prosaic tour buses by which so many of the Prado’s visitors arrive each day.<br /><br />\\r\\n\tThe strategy of excavation dominates the scheme, with the new components becoming a backdrop, or “nonbuilding,” enhancing the existing urban landmark structures. Three primary elements make up the proposed intervention: 1) a new public \\r\\npromenade connecting the museum buildings to one another and to the city, 2) a great elliptical rotunda at the urban scale excavated into the ground, accommodating tourist bus traffic, and 3) a new “mirror” building south of the cloisters, with administrative and lecture spaces, connected to the Villanueva building by large-scale axial circulation elements.<br /><br />\\r\\n\tThe pedestrian promenade connects the Juan de Villanueva building with the army museum, the Cason del Buen Retiro buildings, and the church and cloisters of the Iglesia de Los Jeronimos. This open-air urban armature of public spaces connects the museum buildings to the fabric of Madrid. As an artificial landscape, this set of overlapping exterior spaces connects and weaves together, forming an urban pathway used by the public independently from the museum.\\r\\n{break}\\r\\n<br /><br />\\r\\n\tPresently, the massive amount of tourist bus traffic destroys the entry sequence of this great museum. Our scheme’s proposed elliptical rotunda rotary to the north serves as a drop-off and parking area for these buses and creates a new center for entering the Prado buildings, while its grand scale is appropriate for this major cultural urban landmark. The underground system, accessed by ramp from the south, also services the \\r\\nloading dock and staff parking, as well as the waiting area for twenty tourist buses. In this way, traffic congestion is dramatically reduced, while the roofs of these excavated areas are designed as public open spaces.<br /><br />\\r\\n\tThe new building proposed to the south of the cloisters contains spaces for the Prado’s administrative and lecture functions. The building’s volume hovers over the \\r\\npublic promenade on pilotis, while public stairs and elevators — biaxial to the Villanueva building — connect these spaces with the lower floors and the underground staff parking.

  {title: "Higashi Azabu Office Building", overview: "", description: "The Higashi Azabu Building is a product of its context, yet it \\r\\nsimultaneously detaches itself from these forces by seeking to transform and perceptually extend the site.  The thinness of the building envelope generated by the site is exaggerated by a splintering strategy which generates the formal language of the building.  The perception of the resultant configuration is one of a series of ambiguous boundaries and forms the basis of the functional organization.  A shear in the cross-section of the building, which reiterates the longitudinal layering, produces an entry and organizes the vertical movement systems with their associated volumes.  An isolated void that constitutes the core framework for this proposal reflects the site condition and our interest in its lack of resolution.  In this multi-use structure, these ambiguities are expressed through the various components of the building.  The vertical upper part of the building functions as one of the datums and is defined by a concrete wall; a wall connoting weight which accentuates its detached status.  This wall is punctured by regular openings which appear empty by virtue of the skyward tilted glazing.  A series of delineated vertical planes run parallel to the wall, articulating ideas of spatial division, accretion, time, addition, the comprehension of process, and the continuity of transformation.  An analogy is drawn between the growth of the city, with its inherent additive nature, and the delineated layers of the buildings.

The design for the shrine is therefore based on powerful human forces. Although small in size, this project for a shrine extends its influence well beyond its immediate site, conveying broad urban implications. The initial framework begins with the landscape, an embracing wall that invokes the qualities of a sanctuary (shelter, nurturing, stability, and loving embraces), and an earthen mound with its multivalent allusions to domed cathedral ceilings, Native American mounds, Buddhist stupas, and the fertile California landscape. The embracing wall clearly defines inside and outside as separate ontological and metaphorical places. At the same time it both protects the shrine and draws one toward it. Inside the wall is the earthen mound, planted with the magnificence and simplicity reminiscent of the land as Father Serra first found it: a simple mix of native California oaks, grasses, and poppies. The mound has the added function of insulating the site from the distracting sounds of the adjacent freeway. Outside the wall is a densely planted combination of native and imported species, metaphorically integrating the European influence on the native landscape.<br /><br />\\r\\n\tThe architectural language of the shrine itself reinterprets several aspects of the hybrid regional vocabulary that developed here. Among these are: thick walls (for thermal irregular shapes, tranquil sacred gardens, bells in a low campanario, and the indigenous materials and building craft of “crude perfection.” The shape of the shrine’s roof is derived from the traditional vaulted construction of basilical roofs.

These two arenas of civic space have nurtured the public life of the citizen throughout history.<br /><br />\\r\\n\tThe design approach is a continuation of a strategy begun in 1989 with the Amerika-Gedenkbibliothek, which could be called contingent planning, in which each architectural gesture making up the whole is a reflexive response to a specific found site condition.

  {title: "IFCCA New City Park Competition", overview: "", description: "New City Park’s multi-layered surface moves and folds, integrating a high density of public and private commercial, recreational, cultural, educational, and community-oriented programs. The proposal examines a strategy for making a public urban space that relates to the complexities, diversity, indeterminacy, and ambiguities of contemporary experience. <br /> \\r\\n<br />\\r\\nThe park functions as an organizational strategy for a polyvalent metropolis. The scheme is built around lines of connection and displacement; it organizes the program topologically, in three dimensions – in contrast to the city’s typical planimetric organization. Superimposition, augmentation, and layering increase the utility of the site without sacrificing open space. Advancing ideas that initiated in our Paris Utopie (1989) and Vienna Expo (1995) projects, the park redirects many of the programmatic functions to the lower strata, a series of ground planes, or shifting datums. <br />\\r\\n<br />\\r\\nAt over 80 acres, the armature of public open space connects Manhattan’s interior with the river; it runs from Penn Station over the rail yards and down towards the Hudson River, where it terminates in a floating beach platform. In the areas flanking the Park, zoning envelopes and restrictions, points of connection, and border conditions set design parameters for additional private office, commercial, and residential structures. <br /> <br /> \\r\\n\\r\\nThe diversion of midtown’s westward development across the project site protects the low-rise residential community of Clinton, currently in the path of development, and instead locates new density adjacent to the most intense multi-modal transportation system in the region. The transportation plan maximizes the utility of the existing infrastructure, and makes strategic additions to the network: a new street-based light rail loop and automated People Mover connect with Penn Station trains, subways and buses, and the ferry. <br /> <br />\\r\\n\\r\\nThe scheme takes advantage of energy flows on the site to create more sustainable, integrated systems: vents in the park structure convert the heat of the trains stored below into energy, turbines in the beach platform capture energy from the Hudson’s tidal flows, and the orientation of the park lies on the true solar east-west axis. <br /> <br />\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this urban paradigm, development is dynamic; a flexible process that responds to changes in population, program, economy, energy, and transportation over time. The emerging urban construct is no longer linked to a singular city typology, but simultaneously embodies those of historical and emerging cities. <br /> <br />\\r\\n<div><object classid=\"clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000\" style=\"width:420px;height:272px\" id=\"359b5beb-01a0-de7a-e0f4-0193d43198fc\" ><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://static.issuu.com/webembed/viewers/style1/v2/IssuuReader.swf?mode=mini&backgroundColor=%23222222&documentId=110915193030-f264ddf355df489d8f4a9678d6233829\" /><param name=\"allowfullscreen\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"menu\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"transparent\"/><embed src=\"http://static.issuu.com/webembed/viewers/style1/v2/IssuuReader.swf\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" menu=\"false\" wmode=\"transparent\" style=\"width:420px;height:272px\" flashvars=\"mode=mini&backgroundColor=%23222222&documentId=110915193030-f264ddf355df489d8f4a9678d6233829\" /></object><div style=\"width:420px;text-align:left;\"><a href=\"http://issuu.com/morphosis_architects/docs/ifcca_new_city_park_fullbook?mode=window\" target=\"_blank\">Open publication</a> - Free <a href=\"http://issuu.com\" target=\"_blank\">publishing</a> - <a href=\"http://issuu.com/search?q=ifcca\" target=\"_blank\">More ifcca</a></div></div>\\r\\n\\r\\n", program: "Planning/urban design proposal for Manhattan's West Side", client: "Canadian Center for Architecture, Montreal, Canada", size: 3500000, site_area: "40.0", lat: nil, lon: nil, street_address: "", zip: nil, design_sdate: "1999-01-01", design_edate: "1999-01-01", constr_sdate: nil, constr_edate: nil, open_date: nil, close_date: nil, section_id: 2, height: nil, hit: 22442, city: "New York City", state: "New York", country: "United States of America"},

  {title: "Seoul Performing Arts Center", overview: "An Integrated Cultural and Ecological Vision for Seoul<br />\\r\\n<br />\\r\\nThe new Performing Arts Center is poised to become the universally recognized icon for Seoul, one that is synonymous with Seoul’s dynamic identity. The Center serves as a powerful symbol—one that evokes an instantaneous and indelible impression of Seoul as a global steward of the environment and culture, with an optimistic vision and commitment to the future.<br />\\r\\n<br />\\r\\nThe Han River has represented the symbolic center of Korean culture, economics and politics, since Seoul’s designation as the capital of the Chosun Dynasty over six centuries ago. The unique symbolism and position of Nodul Island, at the heart of contemporary Seoul, is the impetus for our design. The scheme is unequivocally unique to the ecology and topography of its site: it redefines the site boundaries to encompass the whole island, incorporates a nature preserve as an integral part of the design, and brings the surrounding water onto the site. Beyond simply a proposal for a building complex, the comprehensive design for the new Seoul Performing Arts Center (SPAC) transforms the entire island into a world-class cultural destination and an ecological haven.", description: "Iconic Jewel and Urban Connector: A World-Class Performing Arts Destination<br />   \\r\\n\t<br />\\r\\nPositioned, literally, at the heart of Seoul, the SPAC connects the social and cultural fabric on both sides of the Han River—the Gangbuk historical city north of the river with the Gangnam newer development south of the river. The architecture becomes, by virtue of its sculpted and indelible form, a civic jewel in the river, with distinct facets visible from all corners of the city. From the banks of the Hangang and vantage points throughout Seoul, the SPAC appears to shift continually—not a fixed image but rather a dynamic structure that responds to its site, environment, and time of day. The SPAC’s form bifurcates to house the distinct volumes of the two performance halls: the northern Opera Theater and the southern Symphony Hall. From the Gangnam (to the south), the primary view is of the undulating forms of the Center as they interact with and integrate with the surrounding landscape; from the Gangbuk (to the north), the SPAC’s reflective forms reach out over the water, to establish a distinctive and iconic civic landmark. The SPAC transforms diurnally: by day, its skin appears reflective, shimmering with light bounced off the water, while by night it appears to glow, its translucent skin revealing the activity within. <br />\\r\\n\\r\\n<br />\\r\\nWhen a visitor crosses onto the island, he transitions from his daily urban life to the ceremonial experience of performance, to the respite of the nature preserve. From the island, the visitor enjoys both the new Center’s cultural assets and nature preserve, while simultaneously experiencing a unique perspective on the river and the city beyond.<br /> \\r\\n<br />\\r\\nA Dynamic Arrival: Public Plaza & Great Canyon<br />\\r\\n<br />\\r\\nOur scheme incorporates a new public plaza—a valuable asset to the city of Seoul that reinforces the SPAC as a civic destination. Approaching from Han River Bridge, the public plaza welcomes visitors and provides an outdoor space for groups to congregate. From the plaza, visitors enjoy views of both the Center to the east and the sweeping landscape to the west.<br />\\r\\n<br />\\r\\nThe dynamic arrival sequence incrementally reveals spectacular views of the water, the performance halls, and the natural terrain. From a recessed drop off point, the visitor ascends across the gently sloping plaza to arrive at the new Performing Art Center’s grand entry. At this moment, the forms of the two performance halls converge. The visitor slips between the surging forms into the main lobby, as if passing through a dramatic natural canyon that frames a long view of the water. Alternately, prior to formal entry into the Grand Lobby, the visitor can proceed directly up to the SPAC’s Studio Theater or restaurant.<br />\\r\\n{break}\\r\\n\\r\\n<br />\\r\\nGrand Lobby & Dramatic Views of the Water<br />\\r\\nAfter passing through the glazed entry, the visitor arrives at the Grand Lobby, his perspective extended with expansive views of a reflecting pool and the river beyond, through a faceted, full-height glass curtain wall. As the visitor gazes upward, a series of dynamic tiers (which serve as foyers for each hall) project overhead, animating the soaring interior space. He may then choose to ascend to the performance halls, or to descend to explore the viewing deck and bar/café along the water’s edge. Recessed below water level, the viewing deck situates the surface of the reflecting pool at the viewer’s eye level—affording the illusion of being “in” the water while standing on dry ground.<br />\\r\\n\t<br />\\r\\nA Transition from Daily Life to the World of Performance\\r\\nThe formal entry sequence leading from the Grand Lobby to the performance halls conveys the civility, cosmopolitan nature, and symbolism of the opera and the symphony. Throughout the procession, guests enjoy views to the river and city beyond while simultaneously engaging in and themselves becoming part of the public spectacle—the “theater within theater,” as they gaze upon their fellow performance-goers. In the tradition of Garnier’s Paris Opéra and Sharoun’s Berlin Philharmonic, life becomes theater.<br />\\r\\n<br />\\r\\nFrom the Grand Lobby, the guest ascends to the Opera or Symphony Lobby; is directed to the proper foyer tier to access theater seating; then enters the pristine sculptural form of the hall—transported into the captivating world of the performance. While the 1,600-seat Opera Theater’s comprises a classic format and stately character, its acoustics are optimized to afford an intimate experience of the sound and intensify the connection between audience and performers. The 2000-seat, state-of-the-art Concert Hall’s levels of balconies, refined form, and lush material palette lend a majestic scale to the hall.<br />\\r\\n<br />\\r\\nGracious Promenade to the Eco-Park <br />\\r\\nA rooftop promenade takes performance-goers and the public from the Performing Arts Center to the Eco-Park and the Amphitheater on the western side of the island. From the top-floor restaurant, the visitor traverses the green roof, via an exterior promenade. Small shops, studios and a learning center line the promenade as it passes over Han River Bridge. The promenade then splits into three paths leading to the Eco-Park’s three zones, rendering the entire island accessible to the public. \\r\\n<br />\\r\\n\\r\\nSymbiotic Relationship Between Building, Landscape and Water<br />\\r\\n<br />\\r\\nOur proposal creates an environment that functions as an ecological and cultural oasis—a complementary counterpoint to Seoul’s dynamism and intensity. Our scheme augments the Nodul Island landscape with a new Eco-Park and integrates with the surrounding water, to offer city dweller and international visitor alike a natural respite from one of the world’s most populous and vibrant urban centers. The SPAC’s architectural forms move into and out of the island’s sculpted terrain, interweaving building with landscape and built environment with site. The design not only affords a valuable natural public amenity, but also maximizes energy efficiency and the responsible use of resources for the Performing Arts Center, extending the City’s ongoing sustainable initiatives.<br />\\r\\n<br />\\r\\nIntegrating Water<br />\\r\\nThe scheme fundamentally re-shapes the island, bringing water onto the site to integrate with the architecture, accentuating the island’s symbiotic connection to the river. At the eastern tip of the island, the barrier of the low sea wall defines a permanent, controlled reflecting pool, visually connected with the river via an infinity edge. The Eastern faceted glass façade cants forward to capture shimmering light reflected off the surface of the pool. A series of public gathering spaces overlook the reflecting pool, giving visitors a more direct and visceral experience of the water. <br />\\r\\n<br />\\r\\nWater also plays a key role in the SPAC’s cutting edge sustainable systems: to condition the building and maximize energy efficiency, water from the building passes through a pipe submerged in the river, where it is cooled and used as a heat pump. A separate system collects rainwater and grey water, and distributes it to the nature reserve, where plant species and ground materials naturally filter the water. The cleaned water then moves on to the reflecting pool, and finally flows over the infinity edge back into the river.<br />\\r\\n<br />\\r\\nAn Ecological Haven<br />\\r\\nBy concentrating the program areas for the SPAC and the Music Park for Youth around the Han River Bridge, the scheme cedes the remaining open space for an extensive nature preserve. The Eco-Park comprises three landscape zones, each accessible to the public via promenades and paths.<br />\\r\\n<br />\\r\\n- The Great Lawn: Behind the Amphitheater, the manicured Great Lawn affords a more informal viewing area for the Music Park for Youth performances, and a recreational space when performances are not in session.<br />\\r\\n- Wetlands: The wetlands conform with the island’s natural topography and function as a key sustainable component. The wetlands maintain habitat for the island’s endangered toad, and facilitate the water management and natural filtration system.\\r\\n- Wooded grasslands: Woods and grasslands ring the western tip of the island, providing a shaded natural destination just outside the city.<br />\\r\\n\\r\\n<br />\\r\\nOur proposal capitalizes on the unique attributes of the site—its topography, its waterfront, its singular views of Seoul, its symbolism and history—to create an international landmark for Seoul. When complete, the new Seoul Performing Arts Center and Nodul Island will be completely and inseparably integrated, in a project that, like Utzon’s Opera House for Sydney, will come to define the city of Seoul’s rising cultural influence. <br />\\r\\n", program: "Opera theater and concert hall with supporting areas", client: "Municipality of Seoul, Seoul Performing Arts Center", size: 376737, site_area: "13.7", lat: nil, lon: nil, street_address: "", zip: nil, design_sdate: "2008-01-01", design_edate: "2009-01-01", constr_sdate: nil, constr_edate: nil, open_date: nil, close_date: nil, section_id: 1, height: nil, hit: 23928, city: "Seoul", state: nil, country: "Korea"},

  {title: "Snow Show", overview: "", description: "<em>If the [viewer] can be convinced that there is, under the superficial imagery of water, a series of progressively deeper and more tenacious images . . . he will soon sense the opening up of an imagination of substances.</em>\\r\\n<br />—Gaston Bachelard, Water and Dreams: An Essay on the Imagination of Matter<br />\\r\\n<br />\\r\\nIn treating water as a transformative material, with potential gaseous, liquid, and solid states, our design elicits a Bachelardian sense of imagination. This work for a Finnish winter outdoor exhibition explores the transformation of matter over time, through the materiality of water—sometimes subtle, persistently ephemeral, ever changing. The design encompasses embedded objects in a constructed archaeology with evocations of fluid fossils and other mysteries. The Snow Show challenged artists and architects to collaborate on innovative structures, using atypical building materials, in Lapland’s extreme Arctic environment. Along with fourteen other international artist-architect pairs, we were invited to design a transient structure made of snow and ice, in collaboration with artist Do-Ho Suh.<br />\\r\\n<br />\\r\\nAs our NAI exhibit challenged viewers to perceive the diurnal passage of biological time, this project provokes its audience to examine the making process over the course of seasonal time; to wonder not only how fluid got trapped inside solid ice, but to ponder how it remained fluid. The enigma is ultimately made clear when the process is explained. Three months prior to the installation, a grid of plastic capsules filled with red-dyed antifreeze liquid was suspended in a nearby lake. As the seasons changed and the lake froze over, the capsules were entrapped in the naturally formed ice. Finally, using traditional methods borrowed from igloo construction, blocks of ice containing the still-liquid inclusions were cut from the lake to build the structure. This process, with its biological timeline and resultant experimental structure, are inextricably connected to ideas about nature, the progression of time, entropy, and the life cycles that pervade our body of more fixed, permanent work. \\r\\n", program: "Temporary ice pavilion", client: "Lance Fung, Curator", size: 1000, site_area: nil, lat: "66.5", lon: "25.733333", street_address: "", zip: nil, design_sdate: "2004-01-01", design_edate: nil, constr_sdate: nil, constr_edate: nil, open_date: nil, close_date: nil, section_id: 8, height: nil, hit: 4118, city: "Rovaniemi", state: "Lapland", country: "Finland"},

They contain knowledge, preserve information and transmit ideas; they stimulate curiosity, raise awareness and create opportunities for exchange. As instruments of education and social change, museums have the potential to shape our understanding of ourselves and the world in which we live.\\r\\n<p></p>\\r\\n\\r\\nAs our global environment faces ever more critical challenges, a broader understanding of the interdependence of natural systems is becoming more essential to our survival and evolution. Museums dedicated to nature and science play a key role in expanding our understanding of these complex systems.\\r\\n<p></p>\\r\\n{break}\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe new Perot Museum of Nature and Science in Victory Park will create a distinct identity for the Museum, enhance the institution’s prominence in Dallas and enrich the city’s evolving cultural fabric. Designed to engage a broad audience, invigorate young minds, and inspire wonder and curiosity in the daily lives of its visitors, the Museum will cultivate a memorable experience that will persist in the minds of its visitors and that will ultimately broaden individuals’ and society’s understanding of nature and science.\\r\\n<p></p>\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Museum will strive to achieve the highest standards of sustainability possible for a building of its type. High performance design and incorporation of state of the art technologies will yield a new building that will minimize its impact on the environment.\\r\\n<p></p>\\r\\n\\r\\nThis world class facility will inspire awareness of science through an immersive and interactive environment that actively engages visitors. Rejecting the notion of museum architecture as neutral background for exhibits, the new building itself becomes an active tool for science education. By integrating architecture, nature, and technology, the building demonstrates scientific principles and stimulates curiosity in our natural surroundings.\\r\\n<p></p>\\r\\n\\r\\nThe immersive experience of nature within the city begins with the visitor’s approach to the museum, which leads through two native Texas ecologies: a forest of large native canopy trees and a terrace of native desert xeriscaping. The xeriscaped terrace gently slopes up to connect with the museum’s iconic stone roof. The overall building mass is conceived as a large cube floating over the site’s landscaped plinth. An acre of undulating roofscape comprised of rock and native drought-resistant grasses reflects Dallas’s indigenous geology and demonstrates a living system that will evolve naturally over time.\\r\\n<p></p>\\r\\n\\r\\nThe intersection of these two ecologies defines the main entry plaza, a gathering and event area for visitors and an outdoor public space for the city of Dallas. From the plaza, the landscaped roof lifts up to draw visitors through a compressed space into the more expansive entry lobby. The topography of the lobby’s undulating ceiling reflects the dynamism of the exterior landscape surface, blurring the distinction between inside and outside, and connecting the natural with the manmade.\\r\\n<p></p>\\r\\n\\r\\nMoving from the compressed space of the entry, a visitor’s gaze is drawn upward through the soaring open volume of the sky-lit atrium, the building’s primary light-filled circulation space, which houses the building’s stairs, escalators and elevators. From the ground floor, a series of escalators bring patrons though the atrium to the uppermost level of the museum. Patrons arrive at a fully glazed balcony high above the city, with a bird’s eye view of downtown Dallas. From this sky balcony, visitors proceed downward in a clockwise spiral path through the galleries. This dynamic spatial procession creates a visceral experience that engages visitors and establishes an immediate connection to the immersive architectural and natural environment of the museum.\\r\\n<p></p>\\r\\n\\r\\nThe path descending from the top floor through the museum’s galleries weaves in and out of the building’s main circulation atrium, alternately connecting the visitor with the internal world of the museum and with the external life of the city beyond. The visitor becomes part of the architecture, as the eastern facing corner of the building opens up towards downtown Dallas to reveal the activity within. The museum, is thus, a fundamentally public building – a building that opens up, belongs to and activates the city; ultimately, the public is as integral to the museum as the museum is to the city.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n", program: "Museum of Nature and Science with galleries, theater, café, store, education, and office programs", client: "Museum of Nature and Science", size: 180000, site_area: "4.7", lat: "32.786733", lon: "-96.806277", street_address: "2201 N.

  {title: "FLOAT House", overview: "The FLOAT House is a new kind of house: a house that can sustain its own water and power needs; a house that can survive the floodwaters generated by a storm the size of Hurricane Katrina; and perhaps most importantly, a house that can be manufactured cheaply enough to function as low-income housing. ", description: "Make It: Affordable<br />\t \\r\\nA new approach to mass-producing low-cost homes that respond to local culture and climate<br /><br />\\r\\n\\r\\nThe FLOAT House optimizes the efficiency of mass-production, while respecting New Orleans’s unique culture and context. The Ninth Ward’s colorful vernacular houses, which local residents have traditionally modified and personalized over time, reflect the community’s vibrant culture. The FLOAT House grows out of the indigenous typology of the shotgun house, predominant throughout New Orleans and the Lower Ninth Ward. Like a typical shotgun house, the FLOAT House sits atop a raised base. This innovative base, or “chassis,” integrates all mechanical, electrical, plumbing and sustainable systems, and securely floats in case of flooding. Inspired by GM’s skateboard chassis, which is engineered to support several car body types, the FLOAT House’s chassis is designed to support a variety of customizable house configurations.<br /><br />\\r\\n\\r\\nDeveloped to meet the needs of families in New Orleans’s Lower Ninth Ward, the FLOAT House is a prototype for prefabricated, affordable housing that can be adapted to the needs of flood zones worldwide. The FLOAT House is assembled on-site from pre-fabricated components:<br /><br /> \\r\\n\\r\\n• The modular chassis is pre-fabricated as a single unit of expanded polystyrene foam coated in glass fiber reinforced concrete, with all required wall anchors, electrical, mechanical and plumbing systems pre-installed. The chassis module is shipped whole from factory to site, via standard flat bed trailer.<br />\\r\\n• The piers that anchor the house to the ground and the concrete pads on which the chassis sits are constructed on-site, using local labor and conventional construction techniques.<br />\\r\\n• The panelized walls, windows, interior finishes and kit-of parts roof are prefabricated, to be assembled on-site along with the installation of fixtures and appliances.\\r\\nThis efficient approach integrates modern mass-production with traditional site construction to lower costs, guarantee quality, and reduce waste.<br />\\r\\n{break}\\r\\n<br />\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMake It: Float<br />\t\t\\r\\nA flood-safe house that securely floats with rising water levels<br /><br />\\r\\n\\r\\nGlobal climate change is triggering ever-harsher floods and natural disasters. Nearly 200 million people worldwide live in high risk coastal flooding zones , and in the US alone, over 36 million people currently face the threat of flooding.  The FLOAT House prototype proposes a sustainable way of living that adapts to this uncertain reality.<br /><br />\\r\\n\\r\\nTo protect from flooding, the FLOAT House can rise vertically on guide posts, securely floating up to twelve feet as water levels rise. In the event of a flood, the house’s chassis acts as a raft, guided by steel masts, which are anchored to the ground by two concrete pile caps each with six 45-foot deep piles.<br /><br /> \\r\\n\\r\\nLike the vernacular New Orleans shotgun house, the FLOAT House sits on a 4-foot base; rather than permanently raising the house on ten foot or higher stilts, the house only rises in case of severe flooding. This configuration accommodates a traditional front porch, preserving of the community’s vital porch culture and facilitating accessibility for elderly and disabled residents.<br /><br />\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile not designed for occupants to remain in the home during a hurricane, the FLOAT House aims to minimize catastrophic damage and preserve the homeowner’s investment in their property. This approach also allows for the early return of occupants in the aftermath of a hurricane or flood.<br /><br /> \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMake It: Green<br />\t\t\\r\\nA high-performance house that generates and sustains its own water and power needs<br /><br />\\r\\n\\r\\nOn track for a LEED Platinum Rating, the FLOAT House is an innovative model for affordable, net-zero annual energy consumption housing. High-performance systems sustain the home’s power, air, and water needs, and minimize resource consumption:<br /><br />\\r\\n\\r\\n•  Solar Power Generation: The roof supports solar panels that generate all of the house’s power, resulting in net-zero annual energy consumption. The chassis incorporates electrical systems to store and convert solar power for daily use, and to give back to the electrical grid during the temperate fall and spring months.<br /><br />\\r\\n\\r\\n•  Rainwater Collection: The sloped concave roof collects rainwater, and funnels it to cisterns housed in the chassis, where it is filtered and stored for daily use.<br /><br />\\r\\n\\r\\n•  Efficient Systems—including low-flow plumbing fixtures, low-energy appliances, high performance windows, and highly insulated SIPs (Structural Insulated Panel) walls and roof—minimize water and power consumption, and lower the lifecycle cost for the home owner.<br /><br />\\r\\n\\r\\n•  High-grade energy efficient kitchen, appliances and fixtures maximize durability and reduce the need for replacement.<br /><br />\\r\\n\\r\\n•  Geothermal Heating and Cooling: A geothermal mechanical system heats and cools the air via a ground source heat pump, which naturally conditions the air, minimizing the energy required to cool the house in the harsh summer months and heat it in winter.\\r\\n", program: "This single family residential unit is organized according to the planning characteristics of the shotgun house, a ubiquitous residential type of New Orleans.

A U.S. Embassy also acts as a\\r\\nsymbolic gateway between two countries.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Architecture itself becomes an act of public diplomacy; as the United States\\r\\nDepartment of State envisions, the design of the new Embassy “far transcends\\r\\narchitecture and engineering… it is fully and firmly within the realm of\\r\\ninternational diplomacy.” The new U.S. Embassy in London is a tangible\\r\\nexpression of our country’s singular, deep connection with the United Kingdom.\\r\\nOur two countries share an intellectual heritage and common legal foundation\\r\\nthat dates back to the origins of the United States’ own foundation, with the\\r\\nMagna Carta’s influence on the formation of the American Constitution and Bill of\\r\\nRights. The “special relationship” that developed between our two countries over\\r\\nthe course of the past century’s geo-political events endures to this day. The\\r\\ndesign of the new Embassy embodies the longstanding exchange of culture and\\r\\nideas between the U.S. and U.K., and ensures that our countries’ strong political\\r\\nalliance will continue to thrive into the future. A home away from home for\\r\\nAmerican diplomats and for American citizens residing in the U.K., the Embassy\\r\\ninspires a sense of common purpose, shared identity and civic pride.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Our design for the new U.S. Embassy in London translate these multiple layers\\r\\nof symbolic, historical, contextual and cultural meaning into a legible architectural\\r\\nexpression.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n{break}\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>AN OPEN, ACCESSIBLE SITE THAT STIMULATES TRANSFORMATION OF\\r\\nITS URBAN CONTEXT</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The design of the site champions openness while ensuring security. To create a\\r\\nperception of accessibility and integrate with the immediate context, the site’s\\r\\nlandscape slopes down to meet the street at ground level. To galvanize\\r\\nregeneration of the surrounding Nine Elms area, the scheme gifts to the city of\\r\\nLondon two significant public plazas: a public park that links to the river to the\\r\\nnorth and a Consular Plaza that connects to the proposed pedestrian corridor to\\r\\nthe south.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>AN ICONIC CHANCERY TOWER THAT EMBRACES LONDON</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>From the plinth, defined by the earth-sheltered consulate’s sloping green roof,\\r\\nrises the honorific chancery tower. The fluid form of the chancery tower\\r\\nestablishes an iconic presence on the London skyline. Orientated towards the\\r\\nriver and the city, the tower reaches out to embrace the city of London. The\\r\\ntower’s wings extend in an expansive gesture towards the city, opening to reveal\\r\\na translucent dome at the heart of the building.</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nA CENTRAL TRANSLUCENT DOME AS A UNIVERSAL SYMBOL OF\\r\\nDEMOCRATIC IDEALS</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Our proposal translates the universal symbol of the dome into a contemporary\\r\\nexpression of the Embassy’s public character and America’s civic ideals of\\r\\ndemocracy and freedom. Enveloped in translucent glass, the central soaring\\r\\ndomed atrium reaches the full height of the building to function as a connective\\r\\nspace at the heart of the Embassy. In the tradition of London’s major domed\\r\\npublic gathering spaces, the dome marks the Embassy as a civic landmark for\\r\\nthe city, born out of the architectural heritage shared by the U.S. and U.K.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>As the global political and economic climate is poised at this incredibly dynamic,\\r\\ncritical, and complex moment in history, our design seeks to create a new U.S.\\r\\nEmbassy that stimulates optimism and the highest aspirations for enhancing a\\r\\npeaceful, civilized society.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>SITE DESIGN</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nCHAMPIONING OPENNESS AND ACCESSIBILITY</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Today, civic architecture must balance the responsibility to provide the public\\r\\naccess to government, both literally and figuratively. Our proposal for the new\\r\\nEmbassy communicates openness and transparency—democratic ideals shared\\r\\nbetween the U.S. and the U.K. The site design plays a primary role in creating an\\r\\nimpression of openness, public accessibility and connectivity. The site’s edge\\r\\nconditions are deliberately sculpted to integrate with the surrounding urban fabric\\r\\nand to invite activity and views from the street.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>CONTRIBUTING TO THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE NINE ELMS URBAN CONTEXT</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The new Embassy plays an integral role in transforming its Nine Elms\\r\\ncommunity. The new Embassy will function as a stimulus for development of the\\r\\nadjacent Nine Elms Opportunity Area for years to come—a commitment shared\\r\\nby the American Ambassador and the Leader of the Wandsworth Borough\\r\\nCouncil. By ensuring openness and connectivity, the site design strategically\\r\\naddresses many of the concerns expressed by the Commission for Architecture\\r\\nand the Built Environment (CABE), Mayor Boris Johnson of London, and local\\r\\ncommunity groups. Rather than “turn[ing] its back” on the local area, the new\\r\\nEmbassy reaches out to embrace the River. A significant portion of the site is\\r\\ndedicated to public space, identified by Mayor Johnson as an essential factor in\\r\\nthe successful implementation of the project. The scheme gifts to the city of\\r\\nLondon two significant public plazas—valuable assets for Nine Elms along the\\r\\nriver frontage to the north and the future pedestrian greenbelt to the south.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Through orientation, scale, and landscape, the site design contributes to the Nine\\r\\nElms urban fabric and reinforces key urban connections outlined in the\\r\\nOpportunity Area Planning Framework (OAPF). The contextual site perimeter\\r\\nstrategy prioritizes openness, accessibility and integration:</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Along Nine Elms Lane, the consulate’s green roof slopes down to meet the\\r\\nstreet, to create an inviting street level experience and visually accessible public\\r\\nfrontage along the river. From key vantage points along Nine Elms and across\\r\\nthe River, the Embassy resembles a pavilion in the park, in the tradition of the\\r\\nEnglish landscape garden.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The Embassy’s perimeter wall pulls back along its river frontage, to define a new\\r\\nspace for a Public Park at the intersection of Nine Elms Lane and Estate Road.\\r\\nThe park links to the proposed riverfront pocket park across Nine Elms,\\r\\nstrengthening the Embassy’s connection to the river. This new public space, a\\r\\ngift to the city of London, directly addresses Mayor Johnson’s concern that plans\\r\\nfor the Embassy’s river frontage “undermine the potential for activity from within\\r\\nthe building to spill out on to a green space overlooking the river.”</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The consular pavilion pulls back from the southern edge of the site to yield a new\\r\\nPublic Consular Plaza. The consular plaza adjoins the future plaza proposed at\\r\\nthe southern edge of the site, to provide an intensified public experience along\\r\\nthe proposed pedestrian corridor linking Vauxhall to Battersea.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The Consular Garden heralds a welcoming entry to the consulate, and affords an\\r\\ninviting, social outdoor space for visitors to sit and socialize while applying for\\r\\nvisas or attending to other consular affairs. The colorful patchwork patterns and\\r\\ncommunal spirit of Britain’s beloved community “allotment” gardens\\r\\nmetaphorically inspire the consular garden’s grid of plant beds, water features,\\r\\npaths and seating areas.</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAN ICONIC TOWER THAT EMBRACES LONDON</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The new Embassy building symbolically and literally embraces the city of\\r\\nLondon. The chancery tower’s distinctive form establishes an iconic symbolic\\r\\ncivic presence on London’s skyline. At 60 meters high (well below the 85 meter\\r\\nheight limit) the tower respects its context and preserves view corridors. The\\r\\nwings of the C-shaped chancery tower extend an open gesture to the river and\\r\\nthe city beyond. The tower appears distinct from different vantage points—a\\r\\ndynamic structure that responds to its urban context, environment, and\\r\\nperformance requirements. A curvilinear second skin of translucent glass fins\\r\\nwraps the tower’s continuous south, east, and west glazed façades. To optimize\\r\\nsolar shading, the horizontal bands of fins sweep across the southern surface of\\r\\nthe building, and transition to a pattern of vertical striations on the eastern and\\r\\nwestern façades.</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe honorific chancery tower, which houses the diplomatic offices, sits atop a\\r\\nbroad plinth, which opens to embrace the public entry and welcomes visitors to\\r\\nthe consulate. Recessed in the ground below an expansive, sloping green roof,\\r\\nthe plinth houses the consulate’s public visa and passport services, main visitor\\r\\nlobby, employee lobby, gallery and multipurpose room, as well as service\\r\\nspaces.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>LANDSCAPE DESIGN</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The inspiration for the design comes from the history of the site, the traditions of\\r\\nlandscape, land form and building architecture as symbols, and from the strong\\r\\nrelationship between the United States of America and the United Kingdom, their\\r\\ncommon foundations in law and the development of democratic principles over\\r\\ntime.</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHISTORICAL CONTEXT</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>In 18th century England, during the period following the death of Queen Anne\\r\\nwhen Enlightenment principles were spreading throughout Europe, the Whig\\r\\nParty, whose emphasis on greater Parliamentary powers and increased\\r\\ndemocratic principles of governance, was searching for a visual language for\\r\\ntheir treatises. Republican Rome, or their understanding of it, became the focus\\r\\nfor this desired symbolism. Supported by the imaginings of Lorraine and Poussin\\r\\namong others, Arcadian landscapes were the popular art of the period. In\\r\\naddition, contemporary interpretations of classical texts, like the illustrations of\\r\\nRobert Castell, sought to visualize the Republican ideal into a contemporary\\r\\nlandscape vocabulary.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>With this classical language, landscape, land form, architecture and symbolism\\r\\nbecame interconnected, fostered in large part by William Kent and his constructs\\r\\nof politically charged gardens. Referencing his experiences on the Grand Tour of\\r\\nItaly and supported by his relationships with well-connected gentry, including\\r\\nLord Burlington, Kent was able to create landscape narratives and allegories that\\r\\nexplicitly and implicitly supported the increase of democratic principles in\\r\\nEngland. It is from these democratic ideals that our own nation’s history of law is\\r\\nderived. As a former colony of England, the United States’ political system is the\\r\\nnext step in the evolution of democracy. With our Constitution rooted in the\\r\\nbody of the Magna Carta, it is no surprise that the prevalent iconography of\\r\\ngovernment architecture, like that of the Capitol in Washington, DC, also\\r\\nreferences classical columns, reasoned facades and imposing domes.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The seminal idea for the design comes from the Thames River basin’s history as\\r\\nan alluvial plain. Prior to the construction of the river’s embankment, aits (small\\r\\nislands formed over time by layers of sedimentary deposits) were common.\\r\\nThese aits were defensible safe havens for the first settlers of London. Particular\\r\\nto the Thames, aits are still visible in areas west of the city in Chiswick and\\r\\nfurther upstream. We have used the concept of island form to both define the\\r\\nEmbassy and its program requirements and create a landscape that will become\\r\\none of London’s signature green spaces. The landscape is comprised of\\r\\nMeadow Roof, The Consular Garden, The Embassy Plaza, the Main Embassy\\r\\nEntrance, and the Embassy Park and Thames Pocket Park.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>THE MEADOW</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>This large green roof, comprised of meadow plants, grasses and trees, serves\\r\\nmultiple purposes while invoking the notion of ait and the geologic history of the\\r\\nsite. It is the plinth from which the Embassy rises and serves to separate the\\r\\noffice of the embassy from the consular and public visitors’ area. The green roof,\\r\\ncreates habitat for a variety of fauna, including the Black Redstart, and other\\r\\nmigratory birds. The green roof serves to regenerate a productive landscape for\\r\\nboth the Embassy and the neighborhood.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>CONSULAR GARDEN</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>From 1733 to 1768, John Bartram, American farmer and botanist, and John\\r\\nCollinson, British merchant and plant enthusiast, established a relationship of\\r\\ntrade that fostered exploration of the newly formed United States and a\\r\\ndissemination of newly discovered flora throughout England. As a result of this\\r\\nrelationship, Collinson’s support of Bartram aided in the exploration of North\\r\\nAmerica, and the discovery of new species of plants which are now common to\\r\\nboth American and British gardens, including viburnums, asters, laurels, and\\r\\nlilies. The Consular Garden celebrates this relationship, and the benefits to both\\r\\nBritain and the United States. In botany, as in law, the strength of this\\r\\nrelationship has withstood the tests of time.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>In the spirit of the First Family’s desire to promote the health and vitality of the\\r\\nAmerican people and in recognition of their own White House allotment garden, a\\r\\ngrid of rectangular plots establishes the pattern for the disposition of the Consular\\r\\nGarden. Allotments have served the citizens of both countries in times of\\r\\nhardship and prosperity and symbolize the self-sustenance and collective well\\r\\nbeing of both nations.</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nEMBASSY PLAZA AND URBAN CONNECTION</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The grand allée of Tulip Trees serves as a backdrop to the plaza reinforcing the\\r\\nspace between it and the pavilion as the civic square within which people can\\r\\ngather, socialize, and appreciate the embassy site. The allée assists in linking\\r\\nthe site to the adjacent blocks and reinforces the pedestrian corridor connecting\\r\\nVauxhall to Battersea, as well as linking the Embassy site to the waterfront of the\\r\\nThames.</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nTHE THAMES POCKET PARK AND EMBASSY PARK</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Immediately to the north of the Main Embassy Entrance is Embassy Park, a\\r\\nneighborhood-scaled green space that reinforces the visual openness of the\\r\\nEmbassy in the context of its surroundings and begins to address a connection to\\r\\nthe Thames River Path. At the intersection of the Estate Road and Nine Elms,\\r\\nthe escarpment walls of the Embassy ait announce the “Embassy of the United\\r\\nStates of America.” The Embassy Park is comprised of a meadow edge along\\r\\nthe escarpment wall, similar to that of the green roof, lawn, boulders, bollards\\r\\nand trees.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The Thames Pocket Park on the opposite corner of the intersection at Nine Elms\\r\\nand the Estate Road brings the Embassy to the river Thames. Entry to the\\r\\nPocket Park coincides with the street crossing and connects physically to the\\r\\nEmbassy Park on the south side of Nine Elms. Within the Pocket Park, a bosque\\r\\nof Bird Cherry places the formality of the Embassy Plaza at the river’s edge along\\r\\nthe walking path, while responding to St. George’s Square on the opposite bank.\\r\\nSeating under the trees directs one’s gaze towards the Parliament building or\\r\\nback toward the Embassy itself. The Pocket Park is a simple construct of paving,\\r\\nlawn, herbaceous perennials, trees, boulders and meadow planting. Facing\\r\\nsouth, the Embassy is clearly visible and the lawn, boulders and trees that make\\r\\nup the park connect across Nine Elms to begin the entry sequence for the\\r\\nEmbassy property.</p>\\r\\n", program: "A consular section including a Grand Hall; a diplomatic area with Glass Dome, Gallery, Multi-purpose room and Main Lobby; and an administrative section with offices, conference rooms, cafeteria, terraces, recreation center and retail.

  {title: "The Past Is Not Where I Left It", overview: "", description: "<em>\"This is how one pictures the angel of history. His face is turned to the past. Where we perceive a chain of events, he perceives a single catastrophe, which keeps piling\\r\\nwreckage and hurls it in front of his feet. The angel would like to say, ‘waken the dead and make whole what has been smashed.’ But a storm is blowing from\\r\\nParadise; it has got caught in his wings with such violence that the angel can no longer close them. The storm irresistibly propels him into the future to which his back\\r\\nis turned, while the pile of debris before him grows skyward.”</em><br />\\r\\nWalter Benjamin, “Theses on the Philosophy of History” in Illuminations<br />\\r\\n<br />\\r\\nIn a dream, which I could remember clearly upon waking, I was falling in love with an exotically beautiful woman who continually eluded me as she made her way through the labyrinthian alleyways which were part of Old Havana. The dream was filled with the sensuality of the city itself, its\\r\\nwarmhearted people, their openness, everywhere music and people moving to a slow, sensuous gait past beautiful buildings crumbling in a colorful riot of despair. Ancient, yet carefully maintained Chevies, DeSotos and Packards were parked haphazardly along my way, and my senses were filled with the smell of the sea, of rum, of food, and sex. It was strange that I should have such a dream since I had never been to Cuba. I am precluded by laws in the United States from crossing borders\\r\\nsuch as these.<br />\\r\\n<br />\\r\\nSo it is that visiting Cuba, in my case to attend an architectural conference in Havana and to contribute ideas toward the ongoing saga that is Cuba, is possible only to those who hold the correct passport. For some of us, understanding necessarily remains elusive. I offer these sketches as reflections of early impressions; abstractions of plant materials and the sea occupy the drawings, gestating in and inhabiting them, often as geometrical forms. These drawings are a record of my own incomplete process of immersion, questioning, erring. They reflect the complexity, elusiveness, and instability of the subject. The context does not exist for a smooth, seamless narrative. Coherence cannot be forced prior to experience or comprehension.<br />\\r\\n<br />\\r\\nIn most cases an architect approaches this kind of exploration with a relatively clear understanding of his/her subject, perhaps because he or she has been working or living there. For me, the comprehension would come via some other method – the dream maybe. I started with some understanding of the historical facts, but the facts of the past seem to have no bearing on the facts of the present. Disillusionment. I had always imagined that the key to understanding was a close observation of the details, moving beyond what Cocteau called the “eye of habit.” The more accurate the scrutiny, the more successful the results. The implication is that the city can be understood, that beneath the infinite facades of building, street, and empty spaces there is finally a coherence, an order, a source of motivation. But after struggling to take in all these surface effects, I felt no closer to Cuba than upon my first arrival. I had been a denizen of La Habana, had walked at my pace, seen what I had seen, and the only thing I could feel was the city’s impenetrability. Instead of narrowing the distance that lay between myself and the city, I had seen the city slip away, even as it remained before my eyes. Which Cuba was I occupying? The historical city? The current city? Regardless, an overriding sense of the immediacy and urgency of the problems hung over me.<br />\\r\\n<br />\\r\\nWhen one is walking, the city comes to life, seething with possibilities, with secrets and contradictions. Since everything seen or said, even the slightest, most trivial thing, can bear a connection to the outcome of the overall impression, nothing must be overlooked. What I discovered in exploring this city was the sense of plenitude in its visual stimuli in conjunction with the economy of its delimited boundary. Heightened by being the consummate outsider (a norteamericano), this lent a surreal character to the entire endeavor. Everything becomes essence; the center of the city shifted with each event that propelled me forward. The center, then, is everywhere, and no circumference can be drawn until the journey is finished. La Habana was an inexhaustible space, a labyrinth of endless steps, and no matter how far I walked, no matter how well I came to know its neighborhoods and the streets, I was always left with the sense of being lost in a dream. Lost, not only in the city, but, within myself as well.<br />\\r\\n<br />\\r\\nWe architects, then, are those who talk, who look, who listen, who move through the morass of objects and events in search of thought, the idea that will pull all these things together and make sense of them. So how to proceed? I don't have answers, only questions. This is a society which has attempted \"revolutionary\" change: the system privileges the collective at the expense of the individual, and at the expense of the work of three of its finest architects (I’m thinking of Porro, Verate, and Vittare). Was this necessary?<br />\\r\\n<br />\\r\\nTo what end will architecture service the future of Havana? What future? What is being transgressed? In what manner does Cuba require new organizational and spatial configurations? Who is our client – this agent of society? A larger question emerges: How does architecture reconcile the individual and the collective? For nearly one hundred years all revolts and protests in Europe - whether left-wing or right-wing - were ideologically dependent on the idealization of the past, or at least upon the idealization of the simple and natural against the complex and artificial. In speaking in Mexico, Octavio Paz has identified some of the salient issues which apply equally to Cuba:<br />\\r\\n<br />\\r\\n<em>\"I do not preach a return to the past, imaginary as are all pasts, nor do I advocate that we go back into the clutches of a tradition that was strangling us. I believe that Mexico, like the other Latin American countries, must find her own modernity. In a certain sense she must invent it. But she must start with the ways of living and dying, acquiring and spending, working and playing that our people have created. It is a task that demands not only favorable historical and social circumstances but an extraordinary imagination. The rebirth of imagination, in the realm of art as in that of politics, has always been prepared for and preceded by analysis and criticism. I believe that this duty has fallen to our generation and the next. But before undertaking the criticism of our societies, their history and their actuality, the Hispanic American writers must begin by criticizing ourselves. First, we must cure ourselves of the intoxication of simplistic and simplifying ideologies.\"</em><br />\\r\\n(The Labyrinth of Solitude, p. 398)<br />\\r\\n<br />\\r\\nAs Paz makes clear, it is for Cuba and Cubans themselves to begin the long and painful process that is required to reignite and reinvigorate their country. To be able to look at Cuba at all, I cannot forget that I am a citizen of the country with whom they have the most enmity. The work on these pages reflects the tension between my apprehension and my desire to make some contribution, to offer some hope to the city and its people. These sketches and the eighteen study models are part of a preliminary process exploring questions of landscape, edges, boundaries, and the cyclical nature of growth and decay within a territory along the Malecón – an isolated and deserted avenue which delineates the boundary between Havana and the sea.<br />", program: "", client: "", size: nil, site_area: nil, lat: nil, lon: nil, street_address: "", zip: nil, design_sdate: "1996-01-01", design_edate: "1996-01-01", constr_sdate: nil, constr_edate: nil, open_date: nil, close_date: nil, section_id: 2, height: nil, hit: 3291, city: "Havana", state: nil, country: "Cuba"},

Vialia Vigo integrates infrastructure and civic space, synthesizing a diverse range of public, retail, commercial and transportation programs. Situated on the western coast of Spain, along a new high-speed rail line linking Madrid to Porto, Portugal, the new Vialia Vigo TGV station will serve as a critical transportation hub for the city of Vigo and the region.<br>\\r\\n<br>\\r\\nVialia Vigo’s narrow site negotiates a 55ft (17m) drop in elevation, sloping from an elevated residential area, down towards Vigo’s city center to the north. Nestled into the mountainous terrain, the undulating roof-scape of the four-story station serves as a public plaza, whose surface folds downward to reveal a soaring atrium below. Wrapping into the train station and continuing beyond the atrium, the plaza’s surface floats above the tracks. In one broad architectural gesture, this fluid surface establishes formal continuity from plaza to station and unites the project’s disparate program elements. <br>\\r\\n<br>\\r\\nThe scheme stitches together the surrounding context and reinforces the station’s urban connection to the city of Vigo. The plaza serves as both connective tissue and vibrant public space. The central atrium functions as the station’s main lobby—the heart of Vialia Vigo. The public plaza’s prominent position and the atrium’s transparent façade afford sweeping vistas of the sea and city center below. Circulation flows are oriented to facilitate navigation, optimize connectivity, and fill the station’s public spaces with cosmopolitan activity. From a distance, the glowing glass canopy that caps the atrium identifies the plaza at night, and lighting beckons activity within.  From the highway, striated lights reveal a dynamic façade that serves as a public communication interface and echoes the motion of the train station beyond.  A metal mesh veils the site from the north and provides entry into the station from street level. <br>\\r\\n<br>\\r\\nThe scheme strategically anticipates and integrates future urban projects: the plaza’s eastern edge will connect to a planned 5-kilometer public park, and a planned pedestrian bridge will cross the main thoroughfare to the north to link with the station.  The proposal also incorporates potential projects such as a hotel and commercial building in future phases. By integrating with both the existing context and anticipated development, Vialia Vigo establishes a new gateway for the city of Vigo that will stimulate future growth and vibrancy for years to come.<br>\\r\\n<br>", program: "TGV Station and public plaza including public, retail, commercial and transportation program", client: "ADIF ", size: 1319117, site_area: "11.746", lat: "42.241608", lon: "-8.712137", street_address: "", zip: nil, design_sdate: "2008-11-01", design_edate: "2013-11-01", constr_sdate: nil, constr_edate: nil, open_date: nil, close_date: nil, section_id: 1, height: nil, hit: 37727, city: nil, state: nil, country: "Spain"},

Against this backdrop, Thom Mayne’s new book <i>Combinatory Urbanism: The Complex Behavior of Collective Form</i> (Stray Dog Café, 2011) surveys 12 urban projects that range in scale from a 16-acre proposal for rebuilding the World Trade Center site after the 2001 terrorist attacks to a 52 thousand-acre redevelopment proposal for Post-Katrina New Orleans. This book and the proposals found within, posit an alternative to traditional end-state planning solutions, while attempting to not only illuminate but also explicate Mayne’s own work and critical processes. <i>Combinatory Urbanism</i> represents a departure from previous Morphosis publications. Both a manifesto on urbanism and a comprehensive presentation of Morphosis urban design projects, many of which have never before been published; this book fills a void in the world of architectural and urban design publications. <br />\\r\\n<br />\\r\\nPURCHASE:<br />\\r\\nBookstores: <a href=\"http://www.hennesseyingalls.com\" target=\"_blank\">Hennessey + Ingalls Bookstore</a> (Santa Monica, CA), <a href=\"http://www.stoutbooks.com/\" target=\"_blank\">William Stout Architectural Books</a> (San Francisco, CA), <a href=\"http://www.petermiller.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Peter Miller Books</a> (Seattle, WA) <br />\\r\\n<br />\\r\\nWithin the US and Canada: <a href=\"http://amzn.com/0983076308\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a><br />\\r\\nInternational Orders: <a href=\"http://www.straydog-cafe.com/internationalOrders.html\" target=\"_blank\">Stray Dog Café</a><br />\\r\\n<br />\\r\\nLimited Edition Signed and Numbered by Thom Mayne ($120.00)<br />\\r\\nAvailable through PayPal: <form target=\"paypal\" action=\"https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr\" method=\"post\">\\r\\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"cmd\" value=\"_s-xclick\">\\r\\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"hosted_button_id\" value=\"279GZSLDNWY5Q\">\\r\\n<input type=\"image\" src=\"https://www.paypalobjects.com/en_US/i/btn/btn_cart_LG.gif\" border=\"0\" name=\"submit\" alt=\"PayPal - The safer, easier way to pay online!\">\\r\\n<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.paypalobjects.com/en_US/i/scr/pixel.gif\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\">\\r\\n</form><br />", description: "<b>REVIEWS</b><br />\\r\\n<i>\"The book is nothing short of a tour de force and should be required reading for landscape urbanists and landscape architects. It's thesis strikes at the heart of what only a handful of us in the landscape world have been saying for about a decade: that the complexities of urban territories require new paradigms for thinking through systems and collective relationships beyond style, taste, individual ego, and only then will new form emerge that is smarter and reflexive and will lead us to a brighter future. Combinatory Urbanism delivers a bullseye on this message…Unlike most books of this kind, the beautiful and accessible graphics open the floodgates of ideas and breakdown the rote of daily practice. Students and general audiences of design and planning who spend time with this book will find it difficult to go back into their disciplinary silos.\"</i><br />\\r\\n--Professor Alan Berger, Massachusetts Institute of Technology\\r\\nDepartment of Urban Studies & Planning<br />\\r\\n<br />\\r\\n<i>“Combinatory Urbanism delves into armatures and manouvers which is what an urban mechanism - a city - is made up of. Looking at structure, not style, Thom Mayne and the Morphosis crew actually inhabit style - if we redefine the word to suggest invention engaging with logic. In so doing, they create new categories of 'place'.”</i><br />\\r\\n--Peter Cook<br />\\r\\n<br />\\r\\n<i>“Thom Mayne has produced a powerful view of how an architect can re-envision the city.  Combinatory Urbanism is not just an architect’s summary of his latest or greatest projects, but is a true challenge to all of us in the design community, to think differently, challenge the norms, and seek new ground in the form of open collaborations for re-envisioning the city.<br />\\r\\nThom has demonstrated remarkable leadership in the architectural design and planning community that has been generally far too silent in terms of how to direct and influence the growth of our cities and our regions.  The design community must engage in the discussion and debate.  Better cities come from many voices and many commitments.”</i> <br />\\r\\n--Philip Enquist, Partner, Skidmore, Owings & Merrill LLP<br />\\r\\n<br />\\r\\n<i>“This book is an antidote for all architects and planners who think that the new urbanism will emerge only through the deployment of historical precedent. Morphosis and Thom Mayne introduce the reader to a serious web of sharp-eyed city observations, rigorous urban research, and deeply contextual urban design programs and designs. Completed over the past decade, the twelve Morphosis projects illustrated in this book embrace the contemporary conditions of the city with optimism, projecting urban production that is simultaneously conscious infrastructure and human-centered architecture. Urban designers, planners, and architects take note. Morphosis well demonstrates that the contemporary city in all its guises deserves to benefit and prosper from the implementation of contemporary architecture.”</i><br />\\r\\n--John Kaliski, Principal, Urban Studio <br />\\r\\n<br />\\r\\n<i>“The Swiss build the Gottard tunnel;  the Chinese move the Yellow River; the Koreans suggest connecting the Han and the Nakdong; and someone whispers re-build the Mississippi Delta.  Combinatory Architecture is Combinatory Urbanism:  colossal scale; sophisticated technique;  re-imagined environments; re-invented sociologies.  Ambitious.  Complex.  And simultaneously artful.  Thom Mayne’s collective form points the circuitous way.” </i> \\r\\n<br />\\r\\n--Eric Moss, Eric Owen Moss Architects   <br />\\r\\nDirector, Southern California Institute of Architecture <br />\\r\\n<br />\\r\\n<i>“Scale is not a given, it must be invented. For too long designers have been limited by the binding restrictions of the scale we call Architecture and the scale we call Urbanism. What Mayne and Morphosis have accomplished in Combinatory Urbanism is not simply the design twelve large projects, but the invention of a new scale of design that colonizes the nebulous, unseen and largely unsuspected world that lies between buildings and cities. The projects in this book actively demonstrate the opportunities opened up by this scale, effectively recalibrating our efforts to a new design horizon. Not since Urbanisme or Learning from Las Vegas has the stakes for urban design been raised so quickly and so high.”</i><br />\\r\\n--Albert Pope, Gus Sessions Wortham Professor<br />\\r\\nRice University School of Architecture<br />\\r\\n<br />\\r\\n<i>“In his new book Combinatory Urbanism, Thom Mayne as a strategic architect shows how city planning as a discipline can be sustained for the future.<br />\\r\\nIn our complex society traditional urban planning in form of a master plan is outdated as the growth of our cities can no longer be predicted and planned. Thom Mayne re-introduces strategic paradigms into urban planning that contain more than architecture.<br />\\r\\nIn his projects new approaches in urban planning can be found through an articulated architecture that considers more than form. The 10 projects compiled in the publication show how a mix of different thought approaches produce complex solutions for a complex society. Not one language, but a multiplicity of languages that anticipate future possibilities make his solutions concrete, yet open ended and fascinating.</i><br />\\r\\n--Wolf D. Prix / COOP HIMMELB(L)AU   <br />\\r\\n<br />\\r\\n<i>“Combinatory Urbanism is a perfect example of why Thom Mayne continues to stay on the cutting edge of architecture and urban planning. From Manzanares to Manhattan, this is a blueprint for moving beyond static architecture and engineering, to the next stage of ‘dynamic urbanism.’  Educators and students alike should take note of Mayne’s innovative approach to creating a more sustainable, just, economically productive society.”</i><br />\\r\\n--Jeremy Rifkin, The Foundation on Economic Trends <br />\\r\\n<br />\\r\\n<i>\"A brilliantly imaginative book on urban planning and architecture byone of the world's greatest  living architects based on a study of 12 of his projects.<br />\\r\\nHis architecture responds to the manipulation of surfaces, forms, ridges, and valleys that dynamically interact with the needs of the sites and programs.\"</i><br />\\r\\n--Richard Rogers <br />\\r\\n<br />\\r\\n<i>“The brilliance of Morphosis’ contribution to questions of the city is the insistence on the formal core of urban practice.  Rather than seeking a series of generic solutions to problems that inevitably share common concerns – for environmental responsiveness, for social harmony, for contextual sensitivity – Morphosis always invests in a nuanced particular.  The firm works for a responsible singularity, infusing and validating its own quintessence with deep research and the active pursuit of the best practices that must defend humane urbanism from the threats of homogeneity, inequality, and scarcity.”</i><br />\\r\\n--Michael Sorkin<br />\\r\\n<br />\\r\\n<i>“For some years, Thom Mayne and Morphosis have been shaking up the world of architecture with their dramatically original buildings, but now they take their innovative approach one big notch higher, integrating urban planning and architecture in a lucid new method of design. Combinatory Urbanism lays out the philosophy and techniques of the method, as well as giving many detailed examples from their growing number of large-scale projects. This has the potential to be a real game-changer.”</i><br />\\r\\n--Lebbeus Woods <br />\\r\\n<br /><a href=\"http://lebbeuswoods.wordpress.com/2012/04/23/talking-with-thom-mayne/\" target=\"_blank\">Lebbeus Woods: \"Talking with Thom Mayne\"</a> \\r\\n<br />\\r\\n<br />\\r\\nSAMPLE SPREADS:<br />\\r\\n<a href=\"http://straydog-cafe.com/pdf/ThomMayne_CombinatoryUrbanism_Sample.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Selected Introductory Material + the NEW ORLEANS URBAN REDEVELOPMENT chapter (PDF 3MB)</a>.<br />\\r\\n<br />\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n", program: "", client: "", size: nil, site_area: nil, lat: nil, lon: nil, street_address: "", zip: nil, design_sdate: "2011-05-12", design_edate: "2011-05-12", constr_sdate: nil, constr_edate: nil, open_date: nil, close_date: nil, section_id: 8, height: nil, hit: 23013, city: nil, state: nil, country: nil},

These broader environmental implications require radical solutions.<br />\\r\\n<br />\\r\\nThe challenge for this project was immediately apparent: how do \\r\\nwe occupy the land of the Lower Ninth Ward given its ecological\\r\\ncondition? We developed a new urban strategy and architectural prototype to address these issues. At the micro scale, we wanted to maintain the street culture of New Orleans—the interaction among residents that has traditionally taken place at the stoop level. At the macro scale, we wanted a house that would respond to changes in its surrounding landscape by engineering it to break from the city grid and switch to emergency mode, at which time it becomes completely self-sufficient. The result is a highly performative, one-thousand-square-foot house that is technically innovative in terms of its safety factor—its ability to float—as well as its solar performance and its ability to collect water. The FLOAT house is prefabricated and as a result is socially accessible and cost-efficient. It is high quality and low cost, and it can be mass\\r\\nproduced. In addition, the FLOAT house can detach from the city’s infrastructure to exist “off the grid” for up to twenty-one days.<br />\\r\\n<br />\\r\\nWe believe that this new way of occupying the terrain between land and water will reposition coastal cities like New Orleans to be at home on the edge.<br />\\r\\n<br />\\r\\n<div><object classid=\"clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000\" style=\"width:420px;height:136px\" id=\"46cb3d76-bd55-9a88-4c95-90496924b128\" ><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://static.issuu.com/webembed/viewers/style1/v2/IssuuReader.swf?mode=mini&backgroundColor=%23222222&documentId=110913183910-0931106588bd4b14be3af0bb1d0148c1\" /><param name=\"allowfullscreen\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"menu\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"transparent\"/><embed src=\"http://static.issuu.com/webembed/viewers/style1/v2/IssuuReader.swf\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" menu=\"false\" wmode=\"transparent\" style=\"width:420px;height:136px\" flashvars=\"mode=mini&backgroundColor=%23222222&documentId=110913183910-0931106588bd4b14be3af0bb1d0148c1\" /></object><div style=\"width:420px;text-align:left;\"><a href=\"http://issuu.com/morphosis_architects/docs/nno?mode=window\" target=\"_blank\">Open publication</a> - Free <a href=\"http://issuu.com\" target=\"_blank\">publishing</a> - <a href=\"http://issuu.com/search?q=architecture\" target=\"_blank\">More architecture</a></div></div>", program: "Macro proposal for post-Katrina New Orleans that returns low-lying city areas to nature while conserving and densifying the urban high ground", client: "NAi (Netherlands Architecture Institute)", size: nil, site_area: "52000.0", lat: nil, lon: nil, street_address: "", zip: nil, design_sdate: "2007-01-01", design_edate: "2007-01-01", constr_sdate: nil, constr_edate: nil, open_date: nil, close_date: nil, section_id: 2, height: nil, hit: 10498, city: "New Orleans", state: "Louisiana", country: "United States of America"},

This strategy enlarges the aggregate park area while providing a significant source of immediate capital and long-term revenue.  <br />\\r\\n<br />\\r\\nDodger Stadium is here relocated to the Chinatown end of the Cornfield site, capitalizing upon adjacent neighborhood amenities (restaurants, shops, hotels) and nearby mass transit stops (both the Gold Line and Union Station).  Parking for the stadium is decked for 4 levels, the roof of which allows for an elevated public park, with direct connection over the 110 freeway to Elysian Park and over to the LA River corridor.<br />\\r\\n<br />\\r\\nThis land swap could provide approximately $350 million for the re-design of the elevated Cornfield park site and the enhancement of Elysian Park, and could continue to provide between $10-15 million per year for ongoing park operations and maintenance.<br />\\r\\n<br />\\r\\nAdditional development of the North Industrial District could allow for the development of new hotels, retail, commercial and residential uses in support of the stadium while overlooking the park. Money from this development could also be put toward the creation of a new LA River Park inlet, with riparian habitat, nature educational facilities, fishing and walking paths.<br />\\r\\n<br />\\r\\nIn the end, the green open space could grow from the present-day aggregate of 650 acres (most of which is under-utilized and vacant) to 1,000 acres (newly designed and inter-connected as a contiguous park).<br />\\r\\n<br />\\r\\nAT NEARLY ONE-AND-A-HALF TIMES THE SIZE OF NEW YORK’S CENTRAL PARK, LOS ANGELES COULD CREATE ONE OF THE WORLD’S LARGEST AND MOST DIVERSE PUBLIC PARKS IN ANY METROPOLITAN AREA.  <br />\\r\\n<br />\\r\\n<div><object classid=\"clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000\" style=\"width:420px;height:325px\" id=\"ad397f90-b3c7-f494-f61d-cbdce81131f8\" ><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://static.issuu.com/webembed/viewers/style1/v2/IssuuReader.swf?mode=mini&backgroundColor=%23222222&documentId=110913190635-fc51832615844430be997cfd79078399\" /><param name=\"allowfullscreen\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"menu\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"transparent\"/><embed src=\"http://static.issuu.com/webembed/viewers/style1/v2/IssuuReader.swf\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" menu=\"false\" wmode=\"transparent\" style=\"width:420px;height:325px\" flashvars=\"mode=mini&backgroundColor=%23222222&documentId=110913190635-fc51832615844430be997cfd79078399\" /></object><div style=\"width:420px;text-align:left;\"><a href=\"http://issuu.com/morphosis_architects/docs/lashp?mode=window\" target=\"_blank\">Open publication</a> - Free <a href=\"http://issuu.com\" target=\"_blank\">publishing</a> - <a href=\"http://issuu.com/search?q=architecture\" target=\"_blank\">More architecture</a></div></div>", program: "Regional park / A mixed-use residential development, recreation facilities, and neighborhood park / Park as a connective deck, Dodger Stadium, parking", client: "California State Parks", size: nil, site_area: "5150.0", lat: nil, lon: nil, street_address: "", zip: nil, design_sdate: "2006-01-01", design_edate: nil, constr_sdate: nil, constr_edate: nil, open_date: nil, close_date: nil, section_id: 2, height: nil, hit: 8180, city: "Los Angeles", state: "California", country: "United States of America"},

The primary axis road leads under this dramatic archway and between the landmarks of the CAA Tower and Civic Plaza to the south, and the QAA headquarters and Plaza to the north. A grand public Entry Plaza welcomes staff and visitors to the campus into its large, open-air ceremonial space.

Lifted one storey above ground on structural legs, the ring-shaped tower encloses a central courtyard that serves as a social gathering space, as well as an environmental ‘chimney’ to draw in cooler air on the ground level and exhaust hot air out of the building. The Tower’s innovative systems optimize energy performance and foster a healthy and productive work environment. The façade’s passive solar shading devices help control sunlight penetration and heat gain, while a narrow floorplate allows natural light to reach all of the workspaces.<br />\\r\\n<br />\\r\\nContinuous strata of undulating planes envelope the diverse CAA Campus programs, to weave together the campus into a cohesive whole, while allowing each organization to retain its individual identity. Inspired by indigenous Islamic courtyard principles, grand plazas and intimate courtyards punctuate the roofscape, to afford vibrant social spaces for the employees and visitors, and harness prevailing winds for natural passive cooling. The expansive roof also serves as a thermal mass, to protect from solar heat gain. The campus buildings provide world-class, efficient, flexible, and comfortable workplaces for each organization.  The integrated masterplan will establish a benchmark for a vibrant, world-class, ecologically sensitive Aviation Campus that champions the CAA’s vision for the future.<br />  \\r\\n<br />\\r\\n<div><object classid=\"clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000\" style=\"width:420px;height:136px\" id=\"81f4de2d-b9c3-5e4f-8731-384c236f1849\" ><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://static.issuu.com/webembed/viewers/style1/v2/IssuuReader.swf?mode=mini&backgroundColor=%23222222&documentId=110913212510-cd01302922854da4b9b3164813fe988d\" /><param name=\"allowfullscreen\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"menu\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"transparent\"/><embed src=\"http://static.issuu.com/webembed/viewers/style1/v2/IssuuReader.swf\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" menu=\"false\" wmode=\"transparent\" style=\"width:420px;height:136px\" flashvars=\"mode=mini&backgroundColor=%23222222&documentId=110913212510-cd01302922854da4b9b3164813fe988d\" /></object><div style=\"width:420px;text-align:left;\"><a href=\"http://issuu.com/morphosis_architects/docs/doha?mode=window\" target=\"_blank\">Open publication</a> - Free <a href=\"http://issuu.com\" target=\"_blank\">publishing</a> - <a href=\"http://issuu.com/search?q=arhcitecture\" target=\"_blank\">More arhcitecture</a></div></div>", program: "Masterplan and Individual Buildings:  Medical/Police/Fire, Sea Rescue, Mosque, Command & Control Center, Visa, CAA Headquarters.\\r\\n", client: "NDIA", size: 83100, site_area: nil, lat: "25.260222", lon: "51.573944", street_address: "", zip: nil, design_sdate: "2010-01-01", design_edate: "2010-01-01", constr_sdate: nil, constr_edate: nil, open_date: nil, close_date: nil, section_id: 2, height: nil, hit: 12566, city: "Doha", state: nil, country: "Qatar"},

  {title: "University Campus Bocconi", overview: "A 21st Century Model for the University\\r\\n<br /><br />\\r\\nOur proposal for the Università Commerciale Luigi Bocconi campus in Milano establishes a 21st century model for the university. The new campus both grows out of the lineage of the university and the city of Milano, and advances an innovative interpretation of these traditions.\\r\\n", description: "<p>Two primary ideas drive the new Bocconi Campus organization: it is a typology rooted in the urban structure and organic growth of the historic city of Milano; and a courtyard model rooted in the tradition of the university campus.</p> \\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Roots in Urban Structure of Milan:<br />\\r\\nOur approach is grounded in the historic urban structure of Milano and the modern tradition of the Tendenza. The Tendenza movement understood the city as a chronological assemblage of collective memories, typologies, and morphological artifacts. In the most successful urban forms, historical and cultural layers overlap and fuse to produce a distinct sense of place. In cities like Milano, a richness of diversity has accrued gradually over time. By overlaying urban systems onto the new building complex and grafting multiple layers of activity onto the site, local circumstances emerge that recall the intricacies of the historic city of Milano. The new campus is thus conceived as a village that has evolved organically over time, to envelop a multiplicity of ideas,histories, and cultures.</p>\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Tradition of the University Campus Courtyard:<br />\\r\\nIn the tradition of ancient and modern universities around the world, the new extension of Bocconi campus is organized around a central courtyard. This model evokes the memory of the origin of the European university: from the earliest monastic schools’ inward-looking cloisters, to 11th century University of Bologna’s loggia surrounding the urban square, to the central court of the Sorbonne, and the quads of Oxford and Cambridge, which in turn influenced the Harvard Yard and Yale Old Campus. Grounded in this historical lineage, the new Bocconi courtyard becomes the symbolic and functional heart of the university. As a place of student and faculty congregation, the courtyard is a locus of activity where human patterns interweave, expanding communication and enlivening the pursuit of knowledge. </p>\\r\\n\\r\\n{break}\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>A 21st Century Model: Typology + Morphology:<br />\\r\\nThe traditional campus typology provokes a dialogue with the contemporary morphology of the fluid, expressive forms within the courtyard. This interweaving of tradition with innovation forms the framework for the future development of the project. Our proposal thus establishes a 21st century model for the University that both originates in the tradition of the city and campus, and expresses Bocconi’s evolving identity.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nConnection to Urban Context & Existing Campus \\r\\n\\r\\n<p>In the spirit of the institution’s dedication to free-thinking, open and pluralistic education, the Università Bocconi campus is symbolically open to the city. Circulation flows and visual transparencies connect the new campus to the physical, social and cultural fabric of the existing campus and its urban context. Located south of Università Bocconi’s historic campus core, the new campus extends the primary north-south axis from the existing campus, across Via Roberto Sarfatti, through the central courtyard, culminating in the expressive ‘monument’ of the Recreation Center -- stitching the two campuses. An east-west axis establishes an active artery linking the Parco Ravizza to the east, through the athletic fields and central courtyard, to the Auditorium di Milano to the west. The building height datum of 30 meters aligns with the scale of the historic city of Milan and the surrounding urban environment.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGenerating Social Interaction & Intellectual Exchange \\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Central Courtyard as Social Hub:<br />\\r\\nThe campus is conceived as a vehicle to foster activity, collaboration, and cross-disciplinary dialogue. The piazza forms the heart of the new campus—a central space for informal social, intellectual and creative exchange.  A social hub for the Bocconi community, the landscaped central courtyard provides a place for impromptu meetings and recreational activities, student gatherings, and for intellectual discourse that defines the university environment. Individuals are transformed by contact with the collective realm through social interactions and open dialogue.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Interconnected Buildings & Overlapping Programs:<br />\\r\\nThe complex in fact is not a single building but a series of connected buildings, fragments, and diverse program zones, through which circulations paths and sight lines criss-cross. The building complex integrates three interconnected yet distinct components -- the School of Management, Recreation Center/Cafe/Shops, and Dorms -- into a contiguous form around the central courtyard. The highly articulated, fluid forms of the Recreation Center and Executive & Master Courses wrap the courtyard, provoking a dynamic dialogue with the orthogonal bar structures of the Dorm building and the Office/Administration building. Programmatic elements converge and overlap, creating hybridized spaces for activity, and provoking serendipitous social encounters akin to urban public spaces of a traditional village.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Atria Link Between Courtyard and Campus Buildings:<br />\\r\\nFive soaring atria serve as the building entries from the central courtyard, and afford continuous views of the active lawn. Enveloped in glass, each sky-lit central atrium reaches the full height of the building to function as a connective space for the campus. The atria not only connect the buildings with the central courtyard, but connect internally between building components. Each atrium’s grand stair and bridges link the intersecting programs, across floor heights and program zones. </p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Transparencies:<br />\\r\\nAs one moves through space, multiple activities are seen and experienced at once, stimulating the mind. Extensive transparency creates openness and connectivity throughout the complex. View corridors extend through diverse program zones creating hybridized visual experiences: the Gymnasium & Gym Cafe look out across the swimming pools to the Cafeteria & Shops; and the street visually connects with the lawn, across the glass-enclosed pool. A suspended 200m running track floats above the Gymnasium and the Cafe, and projects out of the building in a glass enclosure that affords views of the lawn below and city beyond. The Recreation Center/Cafe/Shops features abundant natural sky-lighting and views to the exterior courtyard.  Light wells through the courtyard’s landscaped plane draw daylight into the parking below, illuminating the atrium entries. The academic building’s undulating form responds to the raked auditorium classrooms nestled into the curves. Green roofs and terraces provide outdoor spaces and views: an accessible green roof above the swimming pools for the Bocconi community; a green roof above the kindergarden for residents of the Dorms; and a terrace for the Executive Courses.</p>\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Cross-pollinating programs produce synergistic coincidence and serendipitous social encounters that connect space, community, and the individual.

In the master plan, building density and orientation respond to the site’s contrasting context, with compact massing on the campus’ urban side opening up in fluid ribbons towards Universiade Natural Park. <br><br>\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder the direction of Morphosis as the Executive and Master Plan Architect, the Phase One Architectural Design brings together a team of six internationally recognized architectural firms driven by a shared belief that successful and stimulating urban environments are built on diversity. To create a campus that is both diverse and cohesive, the campus’ main organizational strategy defines six districts with distinct characters—the four Schools, the Start Zone, and the Administration zones. Within each district, key buildings designed by one of the team’s leading international architects become landmarks for the campus. Each district is further anchored by a central commons area to create a campus-wide chain of vibrant social space. A green thoroughfare links the social commons of each district, weaving through the campus to form a grand promenade that symbolically references the vibrant University Avenue of the Hong Kong campus.\\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\nThe new campus establishes a benchmark for sustainable design and social responsibility that champions the University’s role as a steward of the environment. Innovative systems implemented throughout the campus and in each building reduce energy consumption and create healthy environments, preserve natural resources and reduce CO2 emissions, and generate renewable energy.\\r\\n", program: "Campus Master Plan, Teaching and Research Laboratories, Graduate and Undergraduate Student Housing, Faculty Housing, Auditorium, Sports Facility, Library, Student Center, Commercial, Retail.  ", client: "Chinese University of Hong Kong", size: 4850000, site_area: "123.0", lat: nil, lon: nil, street_address: "", zip: nil, design_sdate: "2012-01-01", design_edate: nil, constr_sdate: nil, constr_edate: nil, open_date: nil, close_date: nil, section_id: 2, height: nil, hit: 3681, city: "Shenzhen", state: nil, country: "China"},

Strategically located along the Suzhou River near the intersection of the Huangpu River and Bund District, the Suhe Creek Park provides a relief within Shanghai’s dense urban fabric, establishing a vibrant, connective transitional space between the city and river.  ", description: "The Park is designed as an “augmented” natural environment, with active and passive landscapes that frame and respond to the urban setting, offering new perspectives of the city, the preserved historical buildings, and Suzhou River.  An axis of contours, land forms, and waterscapes is introduced to weave together previously disparate elements within the area. Situated between the historically preserved Li Nong buildings and Tianhou Temple at the east and west site edges, north-south land forms emerge from the upper plaza to culminate in elevated gardens and cascading stairs. A secondary east-west axis of pathways emerges from the internal streets of the historical Li Nong buildings, traversing the linear gardens to the Tianhou Temple and weaving the city, the park, and history into one experience.

Informed by a commitment to sustainability, connectivity, and interdependence, the Eos Tower integrates program, design and engineering in a building that engages intelligently with its unique environment. The building’s form, orientation, and skin respond to the tropical climate, focus views towards the adjacent Petronas Twin Towers, and connect with the dynamism of the city. Named for the Greek goddess of the dawn, who symbolically brings forth the new day, the Eos Tower will distinguish itself internationally as a beacon of optimism and progress. <BR><BR>\\r\\n\t\\r\\nAN ICON THAT ENGAGES THE CITY <BR><BR>\\r\\n\\r\\nThe site’s unparalleled views and unique urban context drive both the form and the orientation of the Eos Tower.  The eastern façade of the new high-rise curves inward to focus its gaze on the Petronas Twin Towers. The C-shaped tower turns and symbolically embraces the Petronas Towers, an honorific gesture that engages the city’s celebrated landmark. <BR><BR>\\r\\n\\r\\nSinuous, shimmering strands lyrically wrap the tower’s glazed façade, visually alluding to and reinforcing the dynamism of the city. As the strands, or ribbons, move laterally across the tower, striations that begin in tight parallel formation at the building’s thin, northeast edge, intertwine and deflect towards the middle of the façade to create openings for light and views, and finally unfurl as they reach the building’s southern edge, expanding on this sense of openness and transparency.  As the ribbons spiral down towards the base of the tower, the building extends its reach—the ribbons articulating the facade become form and space creating both a functional pedestrian bridge and iconic gateway for the development—the ribbons literally branch out from the tower volume, weaving into the fabric of city.  This distinctive façade design is not only iconic; it is also integral to the building’s energy efficiency and high performance, intelligently modulating the building’s relationship to the tropical sun as described in the Integrating Sustainability section below. \\r\\n\\r\\n{break}\\r\\n\\r\\n<BR><BR>\\r\\nThe lower retail, hotel and residential levels are organized around a grand lobby—a soaring 16-story space, capped with a faceted glass skylight. The skylight’s folded glass membrane extends up the building’s eastern façade, to provide dramatic perspectival views from the lower levels up towards the Petronas Towers. Beneath the crystalline membrane, a series of voids penetrates the retail, hotel and residential floor plates, bringing natural light into the lower levels. <BR><BR>\\r\\n\\r\\nAdditional strategies that afford a variety of striking vantage points of the Petronas Twin Towers and the city of Kuala Lumpur throughout the project include: <BR>\\r\\n\\r\\n• The boutique hotel is organized around a single loaded corridor and oriented to provide every hotel suite with privileged views of the Towers. <BR>\\r\\n• The hotel pool deck cantilevers, extending partially beyond the building, to offer panoramic views of the city. <BR>\\r\\n• Glazed volumes project from select residential units, allowing habitants to experience the sensation of floating high above the city.   <BR>\\r\\n• A large aperture in the high-rise’s eastern façade opens up a view corridor from the lower level offices, through the hotel, to the Towers beyond.<BR>\\r\\n• The office spaces and west-facing residential units are oriented to provide views of Menara Kuala Lumpur.<BR>\\r\\n• Sky gardens, affording spectacular vistas of the city, are distributed vertically throughout the tower, providing informal spaces for habitants to congregate, socialize, and relax.<BR><BR>\\r\\n\\r\\nThe formal articulation of each of the program areas—boutique hotel, office, residential, and pedestrian bridge—breaks down the scale of the tower and allows for a thin, elegant profile. The building volume separates between the office and hotel masses, creating a vertical slot that brings natural light into the workspaces and hotel corridors. Crowned with a distinctively sculpted void, the Eos Tower’s profile is instantly recognizable in the Kuala Lumpur skyline. <BR><BR>\\r\\n\\r\\nURBAN CONNECTIVITY<BR><BR>\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Eos Tower emerges out of the dynamic urbanism that defines Kuala Lumpur. At the moment where the tower’s base meets the city, its form unfurls, transforming into a pedestrian bridge that reaches out to forge connections with the Kuala Lampur City Center (KLCC). The scheme intensifies connectivity, encouraging multiple movement flows between the KLCC and the Eos Tower, and transforming the street level into a vibrant public space. In place of an autonomous tower, this hybridized building engages in and contributes to the life of the city.<BR><BR>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSpaces transition from horizontal to vertical – offering a richness of cultural and commercial encounters along the way. Circulation, approach and entry sequences are carefully choreographed to afford a series of dynamic experiences and views as the visitor, inhabitant, or employee moves through the tower:<BR>\\r\\n\\r\\n• Approaching from the port cochere or the pedestrian bridge, the visitor emerges into the main lobby, conceived as a grand public plaza in the air. <BR>\\r\\n• Dedicated elevators service the secured residential parking, conveying habitants directly to their floor, with no stops.<BR>\\r\\n• Escalators lead from the grand lobby up to the retail levels, traversing the lobby’s soaring volume and affording a dynamic experience of the space.<BR>\\r\\n• As habitants move through the retail levels and the hotel and residential lobbies, they can gaze up into the atrium to catch glimpses of shimmering water, though windows at the edge and underside of the cantilevered pool overhead. <BR><BR>\\r\\n\\r\\nINTEGRATING SUSTAINABILITY<BR><BR>\\r\\n\\r\\nMany of the same design decisions that create high-quality spaces also maximize energy efficiency. In response to the tropical climate, the façade’s combination of opaque bands and transparent glazing provide optimal protection from the sun. The interweaving bands not only shade the interior to minimize heat gain, but also selectively separate to admit diffused natural light and to afford stunning views. Like a protective coating, this striated skin offers a high level of performance, unattainable with conventional floor-to-ceiling glazing.<BR><BR>\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Eos Tower will incorporate ecologically responsive, indigenous landscape throughout. Native plant species drawn from the rich ecology of Southeast Asia will complement the built environment. The vertically distributed sky gardens will each be uniquely landscaped, featuring plant materials that thrive in the microclimates of the specific elevations in which each sky garden is situated. Pervious hardscaping will be used judiciously to collect surface and storm water run-off from rooftops and hardscaped areas.  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n", program: "Residential suites, boutique hotel, grade A office and signature retail space", client: "Sunrise Berhad", size: 1157923, site_area: "1.6", lat: nil, lon: nil, street_address: "", zip: nil, design_sdate: "2008-01-01", design_edate: nil, constr_sdate: nil, constr_edate: nil, open_date: nil, close_date: nil, section_id: 1, height: nil, hit: 2927, city: "Kuala Lumpur", state: "", country: "Malaysia"},

The design retains the traditional notion of a teapot (spout/handle/body) and contains the components traditionally found in a tea or coffee service—vessel for beverage, creamer, and sugar service--in a singular, integrated object whose form can be varied/customized based on a set of functional and ergonomic preferences. While the <em>Tea and Coffee Tower</em> has been designed to establish a fluidity between its constituent components in a singular object, it has built into it another level of variability: the object can transform—the constituent parts contained in the singular form can come apart and fit back together again.<br />\\r\\n<br />\\r\\nThrough our design exploration, we were able to establish a conceptual framework and design parameters that, theoretically, allows for infinite variations within the contained system set up for this specific design. The final form of the <em>Tea/Coffee Tower</em> can be varied to adapt to the specificity of four functional/ergonomic criteria:  “handedness” of the consumer/user i.e. left or right handed individual; grip size of the consumer/user; preferred volume allowance for the beverage (i.e. a one cup service or a four cup service); and preferred volume allowance for the creamer.  The primitive model used to design the variations of the object embodies the design rules for the object in a flexible environment that allows for the transformation of the object in an integrated (non-static) way without jeopardizing the integrity of the original design intent. So, for example, the designer/maker can push and pull on the baseline or datum model until a satisfactory resulting form that meets all of the specific functional/requirements of a consumer is achieved.  <br />\\r\\n<br />\\r\\nWhile there can be multiple formal variations to any set of given preferences, it was our intent to allow the designer to retain final authorship over the final result for this particular design study.  Furthermore, while this design concept posits limitless possibilities and powerful implications for mass production/mass customization, because this was a commission for Alessi,  it was our decision to make this a more precious object by limiting the edition to only 100 possible variations. These 100 variations were established through statistical/market research.  So, for example, because 13% of the population is left-handed, we made 13% of the <em>Tea/Coffee Tower</em> variations for left handed consumers.
